<small>IN THE CREEK COUNTRY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Much</span> good place for camp! Heap fine
water!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a young Cherokee brave who
spoke; from the back of his wiry little
sorrel horse he pointed ahead to a small
stream which could be seen winding its
way among the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it looks as if it had been made for
a camp, Running Elk,&#8221; replied a bronzed
athletic white boy. &#8220;What do you say,
Frank, shall we pitch the tent there to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank Lawrence glanced toward the sun,
which was already lowering toward the
horizon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;We might as well, Jack,&#8221; replied he.
&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t go much farther, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Davis shook the rein of his black
horse; and so the three rode toward the
stream, which was perhaps a quarter of a
mile away. It was late autumn and the
year was 1812. The Muscogee country, as
the state of Alabama was then called, was
green with mighty forests, and in places
almost untrodden by the foot of the white
man; game was to be met on every hand;
and the red huntsmen ranged the hills and
valleys, seeking not only food, but their
foes as well.</p>

<p>The young Cherokee warrior led a packhorse
which bore upon its back provisions
and camp equipment. The youthful savage
was a handsome, supple fellow, attired in
the picturesque dress of his nation, and
carrying a bow and quiver of arrows; also
a tomahawk and knife hung at his belt.</p>

<p>Jack Davis was about eighteen years of
age; he had been born and reared upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Tennessee border, and had the keen, hardy
look which comes of facing nature in her
most rugged aspects. Frank Lawrence, on
the other hand, was a product of civilization;
he was fresh from Richmond; and
while he had little of the bronze and none
of the woodcraft of the other lad, still,
ounce for ounce, it would have been a cunning
choice to select the one who would
have endured the greater fatigue.</p>

<p>Both wore fringed leggings, hunting
shirts and coonskin caps; from the shoulders
of each hung a long rifle, powder horn
and bullet pouch; in their belts were thrust
broad bladed hunting knives and keen
edged hatchets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since we got down into this country
I&#8217;ve noticed a great number of small streams
much like the one ahead,&#8221; remarked Frank.
&#8220;It&#8217;s as though there were a sort of network
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed that, too, first time I got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
down this far,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;Those streams
gave the redskins of this region their name.
They call themselves Muscogees; but the
whites call them Creeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me I&#8217;ve heard Running Elk
speak of them by another name,&#8221; said
Frank, with a glance at the Cherokee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Red Sticks,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;They
get that name from the war club they carry,
which is always colored red.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Red Stick no good,&#8221; spoke Running
Elk, calmly. &#8220;Much bad medicine. Cherokee
hate &#8217;um.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both the white boys laughed at this unhesitating
declaration; their nags loped
easily forward over the velvet-like sward
toward the creek; they were intent only
upon camp, a good supper and a comfortable
rest after the long ride through
the wilderness. Suddenly Running Elk
reined in his sorrel horse so sharply as to
throw it back upon its haunches. With a
gesture of warning he threw up one hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The white boys scarcely needed the
spoken warning; they had noted the
young brave&#8217;s sudden stop; and their own
was almost as short. They were at the top
of a hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Frank, surprised.</p>

<p>But Jack Davis had no need to ask;
his sharp eyes, as accustomed as an Indian&#8217;s
to the signs of the forest, swept the growth
of trees ahead, and at once saw the cause of
Running Elk&#8217;s action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; said he, pointing.</p>

<p>Frank followed the direction of the
indicating finger; from above the softly
waving tops of the trees curled a slim
column of smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Some one else has
camped there.&#8221;</p>

<p>All three drew back into the cover of a
clump of beech; Jack dismounted and
began to examine the ground. And as he
worked over it, going from place to place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
like a keen-scented hound, Frank joined
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any tracks?&#8221; he inquired with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any here,&#8221; replied the young
borderer. &#8220;They may have come another
way.&#8221; Upon his hands and knees, taking
advantage of the tall grass, fallen trees and
hummocks of earth, he made his way to the
right of their own trail. &#8220;Keep as close to
the ground as you can,&#8221; he warned Frank,
who followed him. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know who
they are, and as they are almost sure to be
on the watch, we don&#8217;t want to be seen
until we know they&#8217;re friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>About two score yards from their original
stopping place he paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuns!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Frank looked at the signs; there were
the hoof tracks of a dozen or more horses;
and the broad drag of the poles in the midst
of these was unmistakable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose none but the redskins drag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
their camp stuff on poles at their horses&#8217;
heels that way, eh?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Jack Davis. &#8220;But there
are other signs, too. If you&#8217;ll notice, they
rode in single file; Injuns almost always
do that and white men never, unless the
trail is narrow. And look where one of
the redskins dismounted! See the print of
his moccasin in the dust? Only Injuns
have feet shaped like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>They made their way, in the same
cautious fashion, back to the place where
the young Cherokee guarded the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re Injuns,&#8221; said Jack.</p>

<p>Running Elk nodded; he did not seem
at all surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Red Sticks,&#8221; spoke he. And then:
&#8220;How many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About ten&mdash;with packhorses, and lodge
poles.&#8221;</p>

<p>This latter statement seemed to attract
the young warrior&#8217;s attention. His keen
eyes went in the direction of the curling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
column of smoke as it was lifted above the
tree tops.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not hunters,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Party from
long way off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think that, Running
Elk?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hunters no carry tepee; pack meat on
horses&#8217; backs.&#8221;</p>

<p>From their concealment behind the clump
of beeches, the three watched the ascending
smoke for some little time; then as the sun
sank below the line of forest and the
shadows began to gather, Jack said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it looks as though we couldn&#8217;t
venture down to the creek, at this point,
anyhow; so, if we&#8217;re going to have any supper,
we&#8217;d best be looking for another camping
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Remounting, they headed away to the
west; darkness came upon them as they
reached a narrow ravine. Here they built
a small fire, carefully masked so as not to
be observed by a chance prowler; some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
small game, shot during the afternoon, was
roasted upon their ramrods, with flour cakes
baked upon the gray coals. While they
ate, Frank looked soberly at Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we&#8217;ve been very fortunate in
not coming upon any roving Indian bands
before now,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We slid through this whole Creek region
as quietly as you please,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Never
had to stop for anything except to kill a bit
of meat now and then, and get a little sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now that we have run into a lot
of reds,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;I can&#8217;t help blaming
myself for dragging you away down here
and getting you into danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack, as he polished a bone to which
some scraps of meat still clung, grinned
good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why, the Injuns
haven&#8217;t seen us; and a sight of the smoke
from their camp-fire won&#8217;t do us any
harm.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>The young Virginian also grinned at
this; but he resumed, soberly enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;Our coming on this band so unexpectedly
has made me think. Here we are,
away in the heart of this wilderness;
there&#8217;s possibly not a white man nearer
than Fort Mims, and that&#8217;s fifty miles
away. Of course, we&#8217;re armed and our
horses are good ones; but, if we were attacked
by a party of Creeks of any size,
we&#8217;d stand a poor chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re taking the regular chance of the
border,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;No more, no less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that; and as it&#8217;s a kind of a
desperate one, now that I get to thinking
about it, it worries me. Not that I care
very much for myself,&#8221; hastily. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
that; for it&#8217;s my affair, and it&#8217;s only right
that I should meet any of the dangers connected
with it. But neither you nor Running
Elk are concerned, except through
friendly interest in me; and, still, your
danger is as great as mine.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Jack listened to this with attention; but
that he did not regard the situation with
the same seriousness as his friend was evident
by the twinkle in his gray eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, seeing that this little expedition
of yours is not any different from the hunting
trips which Running Elk and myself
take now and then, we&#8217;re not as ready as
you are for the things that are likely to pop
out on us suddenly. Richmond&#8217;s not like
this border-land of ours; and the inconveniences,
such as hostile redskins, panthers
and other such varmints, are not so big to
us as they might look to some one not used
to them.&#8221; He wiped his mouth upon the
sleeve of his hunting shirt and sat comfortably
back against a tree. &#8220;So don&#8217;t worry
about us, old boy; this is nothing new to
Running Elk and me; just the day&#8217;s work,
you might say; and if we weren&#8217;t down
here with you, we&#8217;d be somewhere else, just
as dangerous, on our own account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;it&#8217;s very good of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
you to look at it that way, Jack, and I hope
we&#8217;ll come through the trip without any
great danger. But just the same I don&#8217;t
mind admitting that I&#8217;ll be pretty well satisfied
when it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As such things go,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;you
ought to be somewhere near the neighborhood
of that old French land grant you&#8217;re
looking for. If my calculations are right,
inside a day or so you ought to have it located.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hope so,&#8221; said Frank, fervently.
&#8220;Then my trouble will be over.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in the dim glow of the masked camp-fire
Jack&#8217;s face looked somewhat dubious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fact is,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I think your father
made a little mistake when he took that
old French grant in payment for a big
debt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said Frank, anxiously.
&#8220;For it&#8217;s about all he has now; if it doesn&#8217;t
turn out fortunately, things will go very
badly with him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much that I doubt the value
of the grant,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;But the Creeks
claim this whole region; and it would be a
hard thing to make good a claim of white
ownership, no matter how small the tract.
The whole tribe&#8217;d be down on you like a
landslide before you&#8217;d know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the government would back me up.
The grant is a perfectly honest one; the
land was once purchased from the Indians
by the French government, which granted
it to the man who transferred it to my
father. Upon the United States purchasing
the control of this territory from Napoleon
a few years ago, our government recognized
all legitimate claims of this sort; so there
should be no real trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not in the courts; but, as I said
before, the Creeks will be sure to have a
word or two to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the young Tennesseean spoke, Running
Elk, who was reclining upon the
ground beside the fire, lifted his head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
From across the stillness of the night there
came a dull, throbbing sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;War drum!&#8221; said the Cherokee; and
the hands of all three reached for their
weapons.</p>

<small>THE COMING OF TECUMSEH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three youths stood there, at their
lonely camp-fire, in the heart of the Muscogee
wilderness, with darkness all about
them, listening to the steady, monotonous
beat of the drum.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s kind of a new thing to me,&#8221; said
Jack Davis. &#8220;Sounding a war drum must
be a new fashion, eh, Running Elk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap big medicine!&#8221; replied the young
Cherokee. &#8220;Big war! Much pow-wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack kicked apart the embers which
made their small fire; then he trod them
out after the manner of an experienced
woodsman.</p>

<p>Frank Lawrence, after a space of listening,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something unusual in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
sound, then, is there, Jack? Out of the
ordinary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never heard it before except in an
Indian village when some kind of a ceremony
was going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I left Richmond,&#8221; said Frank,
and there was some concern in his voice,
&#8220;the newspapers were full of Indian news;
reports of all sorts were going about; it
seems that the savages had finally put their
heads together, and were planning a league
of tribes to resist the advance of the white
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we&#8217;ve had the leaders of that
thing down here,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;But the
movement was not among the tribes here
on the southwestern border.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; said Running Elk; and there
was that about his exclamation which said
he was not quite sure upon the point in
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;we leave our
horses tied here, and move a little nearer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
to the Indian camp. There may be something
going on that will be worth knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Jack, willingly
enough. &#8220;I&#8217;m always curious to learn
what the reds are up to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the boys saw to their mounts, and the
pack animal; then with their long rifles in
the hollows of their arms, and Running
Elk with his bow ready strung and his
quiver of arrows handy for use, they moved
quietly forward in the direction of the now
intermittent sound.</p>

<p>There was no moon that night; the sky
was without stars; nevertheless there came
a soft coppery glow through the low hanging
clouds which enabled them to make
their way along without any great difficulty.
But finally the beat of the drum
ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll locate them by the camp-fire,&#8221;
whispered Jack Davis to Frank. &#8220;See,
there it is, ahead among the trees.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Softly their moccasined feet padded the
earth; carefully, noiselessly they advanced,
flitting from tree to tree, from bush to bush.
Because they were in the heart of their
own country, the Creeks evidently had no
fear of attack; therefore they had placed
no sentinels about the camp. And because
of this the boys found it possible to approach
near enough to get a good view of
the encampment through the open places
in the tangle of brush.</p>

<p>In a circle sat a score of savages, each
wearing a highly ornamental head-dress of
colored feathers; their faces were streaked
with paints of various colors and they
passed a long stemmed, ornamented pipe
from one to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; breathed Jack, his accustomed
eye taking in the unusual features of the
scene at a glance. &#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>One splendid looking savage, by features
evidently a half-breed, attracted the
attention of Frank Lawrence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;That looks like a chief,&#8221; said he, in the
same low tone as his comrade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap much chief,&#8221; spoke Running Elk.
&#8220;Him Weatherford.&#8221;</p>

<p>This name, dreaded along the entire
border, caused a thrill to run through Jack
Davis.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Red Warrior!&#8221; He stared at the
famous leader of the Creeks, who sat like a
grimly carven statue within the fire-lit circle.
&#8220;What in the world can he be doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank&#8217;s eyes left Weatherford and curiously
roved over the remainder of the
band; two who sat side by side, and
whose commanding personality and different
head-dress made them stand out from
the others, now claimed his notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must be out of the ordinary, too,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;They look different, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack&#8217;s eyes went to the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not Creeks,&#8221; said he, for he
was well acquainted with the head-dress of
that tribe. &#8220;They are strangers.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;Shawnee,&#8221; spoke Running Elk. &#8220;One
great chief. Other much medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank Lawrence, who stood beside Jack,
felt him start suddenly, and heard him
draw in a long breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shawnees!&#8221; said Jack in a whisper.
&#8220;One a great chief, the other a medicine
man!&#8221; His hand went out and closed upon
the arm of the friendly Cherokee. &#8220;What
more do you know of them, Running Elk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They come to the villages of the
Cherokee before last harvest moon. They
are from the north. The chief is Tecumseh
and the medicine man is Elskwatawa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jingo!&#8221; Jack&#8217;s voice was lifted to
such a pitch that Frank quickly grasped
him by the shoulder to recall him to a sense
of their position. Then in a lower tone,
the frontier youth continued: &#8220;Then the
thing <i>is</i> spreading! These two are down
here again trying to get the Creeks and other
tribes into the league against the whites!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tecumseh, which, translated, means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
&#8220;Wild-Cat-Springing-on-its-Prey,&#8221; was a
Shawnee, and perhaps one of the most
famous and sagacious of all the savage
chieftains who figure in the stirring history
of the border. At the time in which the
boys saw him beside the camp-fire in the
Alabama wilderness he was about forty-five
years of age. He was the son of a Shawnee
chief, but his mother had been a Creek; his
birthplace was Old Piqua, near where the
town of Springfield, Ohio, now stands.
Elskwatawa, which means &#8220;the Loud
Voice,&#8221; was his brother, a Shawnee sorcerer
of great fame and known throughout the
frontier of that day as the &#8220;Prophet.&#8221;
These two, shrewd and able far above their
race, saw that if the advance of the white
men were not stopped the power of the Indian
would be stripped from him forever.</p>

<p>So they set about forming a confederation
of all the tribes, and in a solid body striking
a desperate blow to regain the hunting
grounds wrested from them by the paleface.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The fame of the Prophet, as has been
stated, was very great; the credulous red
man looked upon him with awe, and never
for a moment thought of doubting any
utterances he saw fit to make. Tecumseh
shrewdly saw the value of this; with mystic
jargon, with religious mummery, the superstitions
of the tribes were played upon until
the confederation became a thing of fear to
the scattered whites in the border settlements.
From near and far the savages
vowed to follow the commands of the
&#8220;Great Spirit&#8221; as voiced by the Prophet;
the Delawares, the Wyandottes, the Ottawas,
the Kickapoos, the Winnebagoes and
Chippewas had been dancing and preparing
for the great blow at the white interloper
for many months; and evidently not satisfied
with this, the two leaders had secretly
made their way south a second time, and
were now, most likely, engaged in trying to
arouse the Creeks and other nations against
the settlers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>All this passed through the minds of
Frank and Jack; for they were well
acquainted with the force behind the movement;
indeed, it had been the one topic
talked of in the lonely cabins or the little
hamlets at which they halted during the
journey through the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if Tecumseh&#8217;s got down here
again, and the Prophet with him, there&#8217;s
likely to be an outbreak,&#8221; spoke Jack, with
assurance. &#8220;For the Creeks have been
acting ugly for some time, and it&#8217;ll not take
much to set them on the war-path.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank turned to Running Elk.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did they do with your people?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>The young savage lifted his taut strung
bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cherokee is friend to paleface,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Tecumseh he go away much mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;I hope it
happens the same way with the Creeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tecumseh is Creek on his mother&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
side,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;That&#8217;ll weigh heavily
in his favor&mdash;if anything is needed to turn
the scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this talk had been carried on in the
most hushed of whispers; and not for a
moment had the three taken their eyes
from the painted and warlike circle in the
glare of the camp-fire. That the Indians
were also talking was evident; but the boys
were too far away to hear what was being
said. After a little while Jack&#8217;s curiosity
mastered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if we couldn&#8217;t get a little
closer without much danger,&#8221; whispered
he. &#8220;Seems to me there must be lots of
things in that talk that we ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently the other two were of the same
mind, for they at once agreed. So softly,
and with slow, pantherish steps they parted
the brush and moved nearer the savage
camp-fire. Not a branch was permitted to
rustle, not a twig nor dead leaf to crackle
under foot. Jack went first, and the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Cherokee was second; Frank Lawrence
stepped as nearly in their tracks as he was
able and imitated their movements as
nearly as he could make them out in the
partial darkness.</p>

<p>By great good fortune, a large green tree
had fallen quite close to the spot where the
Creek camp was pitched; the three boys,
snugly ensconced behind this, had now a
vastly improved view of the scene, and,
what was of equal interest, could hear almost
all that was said. Weatherford was
speaking, and Jack, who had a practical acquaintanceship
with a number of Indian
dialects, had no trouble in understanding
the deep-voiced, solemn utterance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Word has reached the Muscogee villages
of the doings of their brothers, many
suns to the north. And the news made us
glad.&#8221; A murmur went up from the other
savages of the Creek nation; it was one of
approval of the words of the Red Warrior;
and Weatherford proceeded: &#8220;Swift runners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
reached us from the far country of the
Shawnees. The Muscogee was glad to hear
that the great chief Tecumseh, and Elskwatawa,
who speaks the words of wisdom,
were once more journeying through the
forests to visit their brothers. We have
journeyed to meet them; we have smoked
the pipe of friendship. Let Tecumseh and
Elskwatawa speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a space after the sonorous voice of
Weatherford had died away there was a
silence. The circle of fantastically painted
and befeathered Indians remained as still as
graven images; then the Shawnee chieftain
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are glad that the great chief
Weatherford speaks with the voice of
welcome. We are glad that the chiefs and
the old men of the Muscogee greet us with
kindness. It is well; for the blood of the
Muscogee runs warm in my veins. Many
suns have passed since we left the hunting
grounds of our tribe to seek council with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
our brothers; the trails have been long, the
rivers swift, the mountain passes hard; but
we are here, and we are heavy with the message
of the red man&#8217;s wrongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a silence, and then Tecumseh
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well that my voice is only for the
ears of the old men. For they are wise,
and will judge well of what I have to say.
Young men are quick, but they have no
wisdom; they are strong when the war-whoop
sounds, for their knives and tomahawks
are keen, and their arrows straight.
But in the council they are like young bears.
My words are the wisdom of the Muscogee;
let the old men give ear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elskwatawa sat silently while his brother
spoke. As became a wonder-worker, he
was decked with the teeth and claws of
bears and hill-cats; a string made up of
skulls of squirrels hung from his neck.
Totems and charms were plentifully distributed
about his person; a broad band, made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of the skin of a rattlesnake, was bound about
his brow. The lank hair of this sinister
looking savage hung down over his shoulders;
his eyes were keen and restless.
While those of all the others who made up
the savage circle were fixed upon Tecumseh,
his were darting here and there, restlessly.
More than once they shifted in the direction
of the fallen gum tree; and each time
Running Elk warningly nudged the white
boys crouched at his side.</p>

<p>But Jack Davis feared no danger; he
noted from time to time the wandering
glance of the Prophet; but he felt sure that
the savage, no matter how keen his vision,
could not penetrate the thick shadows
thrown by the branches and stem of the
fallen tree.</p>

<p>Tecumseh began to speak in a sing-song
voice; item by item he took the aggressions
of the paleface; wrong by wrong he took the
deeds against his people. On the bravery
of the red man he dwelt fervently; of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
treachery and evil-doing of the whites he
spoke with a tongue of scorn. Bit by bit
the tide of his anger grew; key by key his
voice lifted until it was shrill with fury.
His savage audience was stirred profoundly
by his recital; their customary stoicism was
gradually shaken off; his rage infected
them; they swayed their bodies to and fro,
their plumes nodding in the fire-glow.</p>

<p>The interest and attention of Jack Davis
was almost equal to that of the Creeks; he
leaned forward, drinking in the utterances
of the Shawnee eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; spoke Tecumseh, &#8220;at last
the end has come. Suns have risen and
gone down upon the white man&#8217;s advance,
and the red man&#8217;s retreat before him.
Moons have begun and moons have ended,
and more and more the forest rings with
the stroke of the axe which means death to
the hunting grounds of our fathers. The
march of the white man is the march of an
evil spirit; the red man must stop this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
march or his day is done; he must stop it
or he will find his grave on the great plains,
in the shadow of those mountains beyond
which lies another sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of the last word still lingered
in the air when the Prophet suddenly
leaped erect; his tomahawk was snatched
from his belt, his right arm went back like
lightning. There was a whistling hum of
the weapon as it flew through the air; then
the sharp blade bit deep into a branch of
the gum tree close to Jack Davis&#8217; head.</p>

<small>THE WILDERNESS TRAPPER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> haft of the hatchet was still a-quiver
from the Prophet&#8217;s cast when Jack Davis&#8217;
long rifle spoke in reply. Then, with a
hiss, an arrow from the bow of Running
Elk found its mark; Frank&#8217;s piece cracked
sharply, and then all three turned and
darted away through the trees.</p>

<p>Behind them arose a terrific din; the
Creeks, amazed at the unexpected happening,
could, for a space, do nothing but yell
their surprise and anger. Then they seized
their weapons; arrows began to sing their
swift flights over the heads of the running
boys; a few rifles spoke spitefully; but in
the darkness the aim of the Indians was
bad.</p>

<p>As swiftly as they could travel, the lads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
tore through the woods; emerging from
this their way was easier and they could
make better time. When about a half a
mile from the camp of the Creeks, Jack
paused and his comrades drew up beside
him. After listening a moment, the youthful
borderer said:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not after us; we must have
given them a scare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Creek not know how many,&#8221; said Running
Elk. &#8220;Him think plenty white
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad enough for that,&#8221; spoke
Frank, as he mopped his face with a handkerchief
which he wore about his neck.
&#8220;It would not be any too comfortable with
that crowd pounding at our heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>They waited for perhaps a half hour for
some sounds of pursuit; but as none came,
they resumed their course toward the abandoned
camp where their horses were tied.</p>

<p>&#8220;At daylight the Creeks will be stirring,&#8221;
said Jack, &#8220;and then they&#8217;ll find our tracks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and learn how few there are of us. So the
best thing we can do is to mount and be on
our way before they know too much about
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; said Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Creek good trailer,&#8221; admitted Running
Elk. &#8220;Find track, like wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly they saddled, untied and
mounted their horses; then in Indian file
they rode away in the semi-darkness of the
coppery sky.</p>

<p>Jack Davis and Frank Lawrence had
been friends for almost ten years. Jack&#8217;s
father was a prosperous farmer with a great
tract of land which he had won from the
wilderness of Tennessee, and the boy had
been brought up at the plow in the planting
season, harvesting the crop in the autumn,
and in the fall and winter ranging
the woods with his rifle, accompanied by
friendly Indians, or by some old trapper
who had spent his life in the wilds.</p>

<p>But there had been three years in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Jack had gone to school. The school selected
for him had been at Richmond and
kept by a dapper, kindly old Frenchman
who knew much, and had the knack of imparting
it. It was here that Jack and
Frank first met; they became chums, and
during those weeks in which the schoolmaster
saw fit to close his establishment at
Christmas time, and during the heated
term Jack was always carried enthusiastically
away to the fine old house on the banks
of the James, outside the city.</p>

<p>Frank&#8217;s father had then been a man of
wealth and social position, but things, as
his son had told Jack beside the camp that
night, had changed. He had great losses
in various ventures. And now this old
French grant in the heart of the Creek
country, once looked upon lightly enough,
was all that stood between the old gentleman
and real want.</p>

<p>Frank had realized this with a shock,
and at once he set about turning the land to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
some practical account. First it had to be
located, and that meant a journey through
the wilderness. With the thought of this
journey came one of Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very fellow to go with me!&#8221;
Frank had exclaimed. &#8220;He&#8217;s as learned in
the lore of the woods as the oldest trapper.&#8221;</p>

<p>So away rode Frank into Tennessee and
put the matter before his friend. Jack
leaped at the idea; a venture into the woods
appealed to him mightily; and at once he
sent word to a Cherokee village, two score
miles distant, for the young hunter, Running
Elk, companion of many an exploit
with the wild denizens of the forest.</p>

<p>They had been out something like two
weeks when they met with the adventure
related in the preceding chapter; but save
for two bears and a panther, which gave
Frank a very thrilling moment, they had
had few experiences. But the scene at the
savage camp-fire, the streaked faces of the
Creek council, the words of the Red Warrior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and of Tecumseh had been ominous
and impressed themselves upon the boys&#8217;
minds.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the Injuns ever really join together
for a war against the whites, they&#8217;ll sweep
the border like flame for a while,&#8221; observed
Jack, soberly, as they rode along. &#8220;The
settlers are far apart, and the soldiers would
be a long time getting into action.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it never comes,&#8221; spoke Frank,
fervently. &#8220;It will gain nothing for the
tribes, and it will cost many an honest man
his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big war!&#8221; said Running Elk, confidently.
&#8220;Heap fight. Much kill. Prophet
great medicine. Injun fool! Soldiers shoot
&#8217;um like wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, whatever the prospects for an
Indian uprising, the mission of the boys at
this time was to locate the old land grant,
the position of which was set down upon a
chart which Frank carried in the breast of
his buckskin hunting shirt. Jack now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
dwelt rather gravely upon the situation;
he felt that it would be well to return to
the settlements and give warning as to the
presence of Tecumseh and the Prophet
among the Creeks, but he couldn&#8217;t very
well see how it could be done at that time.
It was daylight and they were seated beside
a fire, kindled upon the banks of a small
stream, and eating their breakfast of ash
cake and baked woodcock when an idea
occurred to the youthful borderer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not more than a day and a
half&#8217;s travel from old Joe Grant&#8217;s trapping
grounds,&#8221; said he, delighted at the thought.
&#8220;Joe will be going to the settlements for
traps, powder and provisions to carry on his
winter work. If we can reach him before he
starts, he&#8217;ll carry the news we have to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank was equally pleased at this plan;
and after a rest until noon, for both they
and their horses were tired out by the
all night ride to escape the Creeks, they
mounted once more and headed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
direction of the old trapper&#8217;s cabin in the
woods.</p>

<p>Old Joe Grant was one of those unique
backwoods characters so plentiful in the
early days of the fur hunters. He had a
line of traps, in season, for miles along the
banks of the streams; he hunted bear and
hill-cats and deer, and lived in a small log
house in the shelter of a huge, uprearing
rock, in a region into which man, white or
red, seldom ventured. Here with a packhorse
and a brace of huge dogs, almost as
savage as wolves, he had lived for years,
only venturing into the settlements in the
spring to sell his furs, and in the early fall
to lay in his necessities, as Jack had said,
for the winter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE TRAPPER WAS SEATED IN THE DOORWAY</p>

<p>At about sundown next day as the three
were riding through a depression between
two hills, they heard the deep bay of dogs;
in another quarter of an hour they sighted
the lonely cabin. The trapper was seated
in the doorway, his rifle at his side, mending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
a trap. The two white boys shouted
and waved their caps as they approached;
the huge hounds which had winded them
from afar rushed forward, their red jaws
gaping, and growling deep in their mighty
chests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, Bully! Down, Snow!&#8221; cried the
trapper. At sight of the horsemen he had
dropped the trap and seized his rifle; but
recognizing Jack he arose, shouted once
more to the dogs, and advanced with a
broad smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, wal!&#8221; said he, &#8220;this here is a surprise!
I wasn&#8217;t calculatin&#8217; on no visitors.
Howdy, Injun,&#8221; to Running Elk. &#8220;Light,
lads, and have a snack and a shake-down
for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Bully and Snow, who was a white
dog, had subsided at seeing their master so
friendly with the newcomers; they now
sniffed inquiringly at the horses&#8217; heels and
at the boys themselves when they rode up
to the log house and alighted. The lads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
found a place to picket their horses where
there was plenty of grass; then they joined
the trapper, who was already gathering
dried leaves and twigs to start a fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got some good fresh pickerel,&#8221; stated
old Joe, &#8220;and some bear meat which was
killed only yesterday morning. Hope you
got some flour in your pack; bread&#8217;s mighty
scarce with me just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got quite a lot of it,&#8221; said Frank,
who had been introduced to the old backwoodsman
and received a hearty hand-grasp
from him.</p>

<p>While the fish and strips of bear meat
were cooking at one fire and the bread was
baking in the ash of another, the two white
boys took a plunge into a deep clear pool
which was close at hand, and then ran
themselves dry in the last glancing barbs
of the sun. Then after they had all four
done complete justice to the meal, they
drew inside the cabin, where old Joe
lighted some home-made candles of bear&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
grease; settling back upon the skins of
bear, deer and catamount which covered
the floor, they fell into a conversation
which was one of the most interesting in
which Frank Lawrence had ever taken
part.</p>

<p>The candles flared yellow, lighting up
the rough log walls chinked with clay;
from the peak of the roof hung dried roots
and herbs gathered by the trapper for medicinal
use; heaps of pelts were piled up in
one corner; others were stretched upon the
walls to dry. Upon the door was the skin
of a panther which in life must have been
a monster; bears&#8217; claws and teeth, traps,
fishing-tackle, hatchets, and axes, and an
extra gun also hung upon the wall. There
was a huge fireplace at one side, built of
stones and dried clay. With a little thrill
of content, Frank pictured the cabin as it
must be in the winter, with a fire of logs
roaring up the chimney&#8217;s wide throat; all
was snow and cold without, the dreary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
wilderness stretched away on every hand,
but, within, the fire-glow gave off a cheer
and comfort missing in a more stately
dwelling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, what brings you younkers so far
down this a-way?&#8221; questioned the old man.
&#8220;Never thought to see anybody this summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack informed the trapper as to the nature
of their errand in the wilderness; the
old man, who had resumed the tinkering
at the trap which their arrival had interrupted,
listened with many nods of the
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day them there old French grants
will be worth a mighty heap of money,&#8221;
said he at length when the boy had done.
&#8220;But, in the first place, they&#8217;ll have to be
powerful well proven; and then it&#8217;ll not
be until the Creeks is larned a lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>This naturally brought up the subject of
the boys&#8217; journey and as Jack related the
adventure with the Creeks, and the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
of Tecumseh, the ancient woodsman put
the trap aside and gave the matter his undivided
attention. After the youngster
had related all the details, old Joe began
to ask questions; and when Jack had answered
these at length, there was a silence.
The trapper sat bolt upright, his shoulders
resting against the wall, and his heavy
white brows bent.</p>

<p>&#8220;So them varmint Shawnees have got
into the Muscogee country again, have
they?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been expecting
it for some time now; but I didn&#8217;t
think to hear of it so soon, for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As we couldn&#8217;t turn back from our
hunt just yet,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;Jack thought
you&#8217;d carry the news to the settlements
when you went in for your stores.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I will,&#8221; replied old Joe, grimly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll carry it right enough; and I&#8217;ll be
heading that way in four days&#8217; time. And
it won&#8217;t be none too pleasant for them to
listen to, youngsters; for the Spaniards in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Florida and the British on the northern
frontier will give the redskins rifles, and
ball and powder, and with plenty of them
same articles, the varmints&#8217;ll be more dangerous
than ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Spaniards have never been any too
friendly on the border,&#8221; said Jack, resentfully;
&#8220;and the Creeks, when it gets too
hot for them, will race for Spanish territory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose the outbreak of the war with
England will be of great advantage to
Tecumseh,&#8221; spoke Frank. Congress had
only recently declared war against the
British because of that nation&#8217;s aggression
on the sea. &#8220;And, if the truth were known,
I&#8217;ll venture that&#8217;s one of his reasons for
starting an Indian uprising at this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like as not. The Shawnees are a cute
lot of redskins,&#8221; commented the old trapper.
&#8220;And Tecumseh and his brother, the medicine
man, are the sharpest of them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys slept well that night in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
trapper&#8217;s cabin; and next morning after a
good backwoods breakfast, they bid the old
man good-bye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care of yourselves,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;With things as they are, there&#8217;s no telling
what might happen. Always be on the
safe side of anything that turns up, if you
can fix it that way. For you are in the
enemy&#8217;s country, and there are only three
of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook each of them by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you see my father,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;tell
him I&#8217;m all right and expect to keep that
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, son,&#8221; promised old Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;And say that we&#8217;ll be back as soon as
we can finish up our errand,&#8221; said Frank.</p>

<p>The trapper waved his hand to them as
they rode away; and the huge dogs barked
their good-bye as they disappeared in the
green of the forest.</p>

<small>ATTACKED BY INDIANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> mounts having had a good rest
and the boys themselves being more than
usually refreshed, they made considerable
progress that day. Night found them at
the ford of a large stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Jack, as they drew up at
the ford and gazed about, &#8220;this looks like
a place I&#8217;ve seen before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cache on other side,&#8221; said Running
Elk, who seldom made a mistake in his
observations. &#8220;Much dried meat. Put
there two snow moons ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack&#8217;s face lit up with recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so it is,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t
thought we&#8217;d gone so far.&#8221; Then to Frank
he added: &#8220;This is the place we&#8217;ve been
heading for.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;Is this the Alabama River?&#8221; asked the
young Virginian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;And from now on
we&#8217;ll have our bearings pretty well laid out
for us. Running Elk and myself hunted
hereabouts two winters ago; that&#8217;s how we
came to have the country so well in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>They forded the river and camped for the
night on the opposite bank; next morning,
after breakfast, Frank got out his chart,
roughly done upon a piece of tanned deerskin
in the pigment used by the Indians.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said he, his finger indicating the
places on the chart, &#8220;is the Alabama. Just
below is a place where a smaller stream
flows into it, and upon the point of land
between the two is a small clump of trees
under which is written &#8216;Triple Oaks.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The clump would be three trees, I
think,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;and pretty big ones, to
make them stand out so as to be noticed
more than others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so, too,&#8221; agreed Frank.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;There is such a place as that not far
down-stream,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;At least I think
there is. I remember some big oaks, just
at a place where a creek runs into the river.
But how many there are, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
Then turning to Running Elk, he asked,
&#8220;What do you remember about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young Cherokee&#8217;s reply was brief
and comprehensive.</p>

<p>&#8220;One, two, three,&#8221; he counted upon his
fingers. &#8220;Three oak trees. Grow near
creek on river bank. Half a sun&#8217;s ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack chuckled and nodded to Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;He never forgets anything like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank was much gratified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you, old chap,&#8221; said he, slapping
the Cherokee upon the shoulder. To
Jack he said: &#8220;As we are without instruments,
we couldn&#8217;t locate the tract without
these landmarks, and it&#8217;s a great comfort to
have some one along who knows where the
landmarks are.&#8221; Again his fingers went
from point to point upon the chart. &#8220;Here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
to the north, is a hill; and around to the
west is a pine forest; I think we ought, by
the help of these, to prove if the three oaks
you have in mind are the ones in the chart,
or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the horses had finished grazing,
they were saddled, and the lads sprang
upon their backs with keen excitement.
That Running Elk was a most excellent
judge of distance as well as topography was
soon made manifest. For just about high
noon, when the sun was staring like a huge
fiery ball from directly overhead, Frank
uttered a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded Jack, his hand
going in the quick, instinctive movement
of the frontiersman for his weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The triple oaks,&#8221; was the reply, and
Frank pointed over the tree tops.</p>

<p>Sure enough, as they broke through some
underbrush upon the river bank, they
sighted three massive oaks, growing close
together and towering above their neighbors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
like giants above pigmies. To the left
of them flowed a slow shallow stream of
yellowish water which entered and discolored
the river for some distance below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there they are,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;just
as I saw them last, and as they have been
standing for at least a hundred years.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all dismounted, and their bridles
were thrown across some low limbs close to
the water&#8217;s edge. Frank got the chart from
his saddle-bags, and began unrolling it.</p>

<p>&#8220;With any sort of good luck,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll have this job over sooner than we
expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he felt a hand upon his
shoulder, pressing downward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down!&#8221; came the voice of Jack,
harshly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t look up! Down!&#8221;</p>

<p>His weeks in the wilderness had not been
without their effect upon the young Virginian.
He had learned that if a thing
must be done in the forest, one must do it
promptly and without question. So he at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
once dropped to the earth; as he did so a
flight of arrows sped over his head, and a
dozen bullets hummed their course through
the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Red Sticks,&#8221; said Running Elk, from
behind the gnarled stem of a cottonwood.
He fitted an arrow to his bow, and as
Frank, astounded by the suddenness of
the attack, gazed at him the taut string
twanged, and a shrill cry from across the
river told of a victim.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment the long
rifle of Jack Davis spoke, and a second yell
arose, proving the sureness of his aim.
Frank now turned his eyes upon the point
of land upon which stood the triple oaks;
to his surprise, he saw among the trees all
the evidences of a Creek encampment; and
a new flight of arrows and volley of rifle
shots from behind rocks, stumps and trees,
told of the hiding places of the savages.</p>

<p>By great good fortune, the boys&#8217; horses,
at the first sound of the rifles of the hostiles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
had broken away from their slight restraint
and galloped off into the woods, unhurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep close to the ground,&#8221; warned Jack,
&#8220;and after them. We must not lose sight
of our mounts, or we&#8217;re done for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Running Elk slipped from tree to tree;
Jack crawled along the earth with the supple
movements of a snake. Frank followed
suit, and in spite of the continuous flight
of arrows, they reached unharmed the thick
cover of the trees some distance from the
river&#8217;s brink.</p>

<p>By great good fortune, the packhorse,
which was a wise old beast, had brought up
a few hundred yards away; and naturally
the other horses stopped also, and so were
easily caught. The boys sprang upon their
backs and went tearing away through the
aisles of the forest; and as they did so they
heard the yells of the Indians, who now
for the first time became aware of their
flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll follow?&#8221; asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Frank, as he and Jack rode side by side for
a space where the woods was not so dense.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will if they have noticed how few
we are,&#8221; replied the young borderer. &#8220;And
if they cross the river, our tracks will tell
them that.&#8221;</p>

<p>After about an hour&#8217;s hard riding they
slackened their pace, and then at the top of
a knoll they halted. They had emerged
from the forest some time ago, and from
where they were they had a clear view of
the surrounding country for miles around.</p>

<p>Away swept the green of the early autumn,
all rippling in the breeze and shining
in the sunlight. Here and there a splotch
of yellow or red marked where the fall had
already set its hand. The sky was cloudless
and the air very clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the sort of a day when we can see
great distances,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think I remember ever seeing a finer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and just because of that,&#8221; said
Jack Davis, with the caution of experience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
&#8220;we&#8217;d better not stand here in such full
view. If there are any reds on our trail,
they&#8217;ll mark us, even if they&#8217;re still miles
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; agreed Running Elk, in prompt
approval. &#8220;Creek have good eyes. See
far!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they drew back below the shoulder of
the knoll, dismounted and gave the horses a
breathing space. Frank, as he watched his
friend, saw that his face was serious and
that his looks in the direction of the waving
green forest which they had left behind
were intense. Running Elk also kept his
keen black eyes upon the distant woods; as
he stood watching, with barbaric composure,
he had the appearance of a splendidly
wrought bronze, meant to typify vigilance
and grace.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; said he, pointing.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a big band of them, and they are
following in our tracks like hounds.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>From out the green of the woods came a
full score of Creeks. Some were mounted
and some were afoot. They carried shields
and spears and bows and arrows; and here
and there the metal of a rifle barrel glistened
as the sun&#8217;s rays struck it.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to come on boldly, and without
much thought of concealment,&#8221; said
Frank, after he had watched them for a
moment. &#8220;And that is not at all the way
I thought Indians made war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um, Creek no care who see,&#8221; stated
Running Elk. &#8220;Got hill, with ring around
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said Frank, only partly
catching the Cherokee&#8217;s meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means that they&#8217;ve got us surrounded,&#8221;
said Jack Davis. &#8220;And he&#8217;s
right. Just throw a look around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Startled, Frank did so; his heart gave a
leap and began to beat swifter; from all directions,
closing in upon the knoll, were
bands of armed savages.</p>

<small>THE FIGHT ON THE KNOLL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment or two Frank Lawrence
was too startled to speak; but when he
could collect his wits his first action was to
throw his rifle around in position for use;
his second was to look at Jack Davis and
the Cherokee hunter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, quietly enough, &#8220;we
seem to be in for it, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good hundred of them, all
told,&#8221; spoke Jack. &#8220;I wonder where they
all sprang from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young men,&#8221; said Running Elk.
&#8220;Braves. Old men in council; young
men come afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; cried Jack, grasping at the
Cherokee hunter&#8217;s meaning. &#8220;Weatherford,
chief of the Creeks, took his old men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
forward to hear and talk with Tecumseh
and the prophet at the council fire. The
young men, or warriors, were left a few
days&#8217; march behind; they were on their
way to join their chief when we ran into
them at the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse luck for us,&#8221; grumbled Frank,
his eyes on the advancing Indians. &#8220;What
shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain to Jack and Running Elk
that the Creeks had used their superior
knowledge of the country to their great
advantage. They had seen the direction
taken by the boys and knowing, very
likely, the course they must take through
the forest if they desired to make speed,
the red men had cunningly thrown parties
forward along various paths through the
woods, short cuts known only to themselves
and the wild things, and so had
managed to form a ring about them when
they had least expected it.</p>

<p>To stand at the top of the grassy knoll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and see the Creeks advance upon all sides
was an experience the like of which Frank
Lawrence had never undergone before.
The sun glanced upon the oily bronze
skins of the braves, their eagle and heron
plumes nodded in the breeze, their buckskin
leggings and quilled and beaded ornaments
were interesting and picturesque.
But Frank knew that there was something
more than show in the force moving so
slowly, so surely toward them; he knew
that if they were not checked, their presence
in such numbers meant almost certain
death to him and his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they are in range?&#8221;
asked he, looking at Jack.</p>

<p>Young Davis swept the distant Creeks
with an estimating glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by fifty yards,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And
we&#8217;ll give them twenty-five more than that,
for we must not waste any ammunition.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jack did not give the Indians much
attention at the moment; as soon as he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
answered Frank&#8217;s question, he turned to a
place at the top of the knoll which had
caught his eye a few moments before. This
was a bowl-like depression, possibly fifteen
yards across and some four feet in depth.
The young Tennesseean leaped into this,
and walked about, trying it at various
places for a view of the sloping sides of
the knoll.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the thing,&#8221; cried he, excitedly.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have been better placed if it
had been made for the occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Catching Jack&#8217;s idea, the others also
sprang into the depression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; exclaimed Frank. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite
a fort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Made for fort,&#8221; stated Running Elk,
whose searching glance had been going
about. &#8220;Long time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>At once the four horses were driven into
the bowl, and made to lie down in the
center; then the defenders gave their attention
to the oncoming foe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>The Creeks had come on slowly; it was
evident that they felt sure of their prey
and so were in no great hurry to close in.
At the head of the band advancing from
the direction of the forest was a tall, evil
looking brave carrying a long tufted spear;
he seemed to exult in the prospect of bringing
death to the white face, and he danced
fantastically and flourished the spear.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are about in range now,&#8221; said
Jack Davis, as he threw his long rifle forward.
&#8220;But hold your fire, Frank, until I
have a try.&#8221; The piece went to his shoulder,
the barrel resting upon the edge of the
hollow. &#8220;That fellow doing the dancing
seems to be mighty pleased,&#8221; added the
young borderer, grimly. &#8220;So I just think
I&#8217;ll try to make him laugh on the other side
of his mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The long tube of the rifle held steadily
upon the exultant savage for an instant;
then the weapon cracked; the tufted spear
was flung high in the air, as the Creek&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
arms went up; and with a yell he dropped
prone upon the sward.</p>

<p>A chorus of yells followed this; and
while they were still sounding, Frank&#8217;s
piece spoke clearly and spitefully; a warrior
in advance of his fellows, upon the opposite
side, screeched his death note and fell to
the earth.</p>

<p>At once the bands to which the fallen
braves had belonged scattered and fell
back. They were still out of bow shot; a
few rifles sounded from among them, but
the pieces were of obsolete pattern and poor
range, so the bullets did no harm. However,
the parties upon the two other sides
had sustained no loss; and so they came on
with a speed greatly increased by the yells
and shots.</p>

<p>With cool, practiced hands, the two young
riflemen rammed home fresh charges of
powder and ball; Frank sprang to one side
and Jack to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sight &#8217;em carefully,&#8221; admonished Jack,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
&#8220;and don&#8217;t let go until you&#8217;re sure of bringing
down your Injun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the long weapons cracked, one
after the other, and two more Creeks fell
with wide flung arms and yells of pain.
And that was not all. The youthful
Cherokee had been impatiently waiting a
chance to bring his bow into the conflict;
the chance had now come. So he rose up
beside Frank and the bowstring sang
shrilly. The feathered shaft whistled
through the air and found its mark; then
before the stricken brave had sunk to the
ground, the pantherish speed of Running
Elk had carried him across the little fort;
upon the opposite side, the one covered by
Jack, the bowstring sounded again, and
another warrior fell, transfixed through the
shoulder.</p>

<p>With four more of their number down,
the Creeks let fly a perfect rain of arrows;
their rifles rang out in a scattered volley,
and they came on vengefully. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
ready bow of the Cherokee continued to
twang; the rifles of the two young marksmen
were reloaded and again laid a brace
of warriors low. This was too much for the
Creeks; all their ideas of warfare, which
was to fight from cover, were against this
method of attack. They were in an open
position and their enemies were out of
sight; it looked like death to advance, so
promptly, with the last shots of the two
rifles, they broke and fled out of range.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t seem to have much appetite
for lead,&#8221; said Jack, as he cleaned out his
rifle barrel with a bit of cloth, and proceeded
to reload.</p>

<p>Frank duplicated this performance; then
with a very sober countenance he said to
his friend:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Jack, as that gang of savages
were coming on shooting and yelling like
all possessed, it struck me that we were in
a rather desperate situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Davis pulled a wry face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;I never want to see a worse one,&#8221; said
he, quietly enough, but with a look in his
eyes which Frank had never seen there
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of our chances of
pulling out of it?&#8221; asked Frank, his gaze
going to the Indian bands, clustered in
council, well out of range.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;there&#8217;s a lot of them,
and if they could get at us, they&#8217;d soon
make an end of the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It needs only a rush,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;If
they had kept at it a few minutes more, it
would have done for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they didn&#8217;t keep at it,&#8221; spoke Jack.
&#8220;And that is the only real thing that we
can count on. It&#8217;s not the Indian nature to
stand up unprotected in the face of rifle fire.
Their training is to hunt cover, to stalk
their enemy, to creep up and jump on him
when he&#8217;s not looking for it. One-quarter
as many white men would have taken this
knoll at the first rush, seeing that there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
only three to defend it. But Injuns are
different.&#8221; He pointed with one outstretched
arm toward the discomfited savages.
&#8220;They have the worst of it and
they know it. It&#8217;ll surprise me a good deal
if they pull themselves together enough to
make another attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; Frank Lawrence looked at
his friend in surprise. &#8220;Do you mean to
say there is any chance of their giving up
the attempt&mdash;of letting us escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, gravely, &#8220;not quite that.
But as there is no cover for the redskins on
the sides of this knoll, no trees, no rocks,
no stumps or anything like that, they might
wait for a kind of cover that&#8217;s to be found
anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young Virginian felt a cold, creeping
shudder run down his back. His imagination
pictured the darkness of night falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
over this lone place; its stillness, its ominous,
brooding depths. He seemed to feel
the presence of the Creeks as they crept
through the blackness, slowly and with the
soft padded tread of panthers. No superiority
of rifle fire, no vigilance, no courage
would serve under such conditions; it would
mean only one thing&mdash;massacre.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they wait for night and attack us in
the dark,&#8221; asked Frank, &#8220;what can we
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one thing to do in such a
case,&#8221; said the young borderer. &#8220;As soon
as darkness settles we must get away from
here as best we can. We must not wait for
them to spring upon us; we&#8217;ll strike a blow
at them, and be away in the darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; said Running Elk, with approval.
But that he did not favor every
aspect of the proposition was shown when
he added, &#8220;Creep away like snakes&mdash;no
noise&mdash;no shots. Heap best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; agreed Jack, with a nod. &#8220;If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
it can be done that way, it&#8217;ll be best. However,
when the time comes, we shall see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minute by minute went by; then an
hour passed, but still the Creeks did not
renew the attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t seem to be in any hurry
about it, at any rate,&#8221; said Frank. All three
of the youths were leaning over the edge
of the depression looking along the slope at
the Indians in the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;A half dozen, or so,
in killed and wounded is a staggerer to
them. They&#8217;ll not budge before night,
you&#8217;ll see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a time they saw the savages subside
and go into camp; however, each band
kept its place; the ring about the knoll
was preserved; and red skinned sentinels
were observed here and there, their keen
eyes fixed upon the apex where the boys lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll not be much that&#8217;ll escape
them,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Injuns have as much
patience as a hill-cat at a water hole.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>The afternoon wore away; then the sun
began to lower behind the range of waving
tree tops and the long shadows began to
trail upon the slopes of the knoll. But the
Creeks made no sign; craftily they assumed
carelessness, lolling about in groups, their
horses picketed at some little distances.</p>

<p>&#8220;They think to fool us,&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;It&#8217;s their idea not to stir until their movements
are covered by darkness; and in that
way, so they imagine, they&#8217;ll lure us into
thinking they are not going to move at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the shadows thickened; twilight
passed and night settled upon the wilds.
There were countless stars in the sky; but
they seemed very far off and their glimmering
cast no light; the moon would not
show itself for some hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; said Jack Davis. &#8220;If we are
going to make the attempt, now is the
time. Are you willing, Frank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll follow right after you wherever
you go,&#8221; replied the young Virginian.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Get away now, or Creek take &#8217;um
scalp,&#8221; said Running Elk.</p>

<p>They got their horses to their feet and
out of the hollow; Jack had laid his plan
before night settled, and he knew what he
wanted to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right after me, one at a time,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Lead your horses, and when you feel me
stop, do the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down the slope of the knoll went the three,
in Indian file; ahead of them all was dusk;
around them the silence settled like death.</p>

<p>Half-way down, Jack paused; the others
did likewise, as directed, the horses huddling
together for companionship. Frank
was about to whisper a question as to why
they had halted, but Jack stopped him at
the first syllable. Then the young Virginian
became aware of a movement in the
darkness near to them&mdash;the soft, steady forward
movement of some low lying mass.
With a thrill he realized what it meant;
the Indians were advancing to the attack.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>SIGHTING THE ENEMY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> the slow lapping of black water
the bands of creeping Indians ebbed forward.
Frank Lawrence held his rifle ready
to fire at the word; and as he stood waiting,
he wondered why the command was
not given.</p>

<p>But Jack Davis was observant; he had
planned the direction of their attempt with
an eye to probabilities; and what he had
figured upon happening came about in due
course. Upon this side of the knoll, but
some distance from it, there was a shallow
ravine; when the Creeks on this side advanced
to the attack earlier in the day,
they split their forces at this ravine and
came on in two separate bodies. The boy
took a desperate chance upon the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
thing&#8217;s happening in the darkness, and so
had led the way, with the ravine directly
ahead.</p>

<p>Slowly the creeping redskins moved forward
up the knoll; they passed within a
dozen yards upon either side of the crouching
group and continued unaware of the
situation. A minute passed, then another&mdash;and
when Frank had finally despaired,
in the suspense, of Jack&#8217;s ever giving the
word to go on, it came. Cautiously they
urged their animals on down the slope;
they were now behind the Creeks; ahead
was the whole wide wilderness. A hundred
yards or more from the spot where the
savages passed them on the hillside, Jack
whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mount! But go slowly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They clambered into the saddle; Running
Elk, who had clung to the packhorse
during all, kept the faithful beast beside
his own horse as they rode along. After
having gone something less than a mile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
they heard a yell, faint, but high pitched
and exultant, from the distance; rifles
cracked and a flare of light lit the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve reached the summit of the
knoll,&#8221; spoke Jack. &#8220;And they&#8217;ve let
drive with everything they had.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the scattering of shots there was a
short pause; a murmur, dull and sustained,
came from the direction of their late fort;
then, as though the Indians had just realized
the escape of their intended victims,
a screech of rage, hate and disappointment
swept the still night with shuddering intensity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as well satisfied that we didn&#8217;t fall
into the hands of those gentlemen,&#8221; observed
Frank, as they rode away at a gallop.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d stop at much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Creeks are not the merciful kind,&#8221;
said Jack. &#8220;And they seldom take prisoners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Creek burn and scalp,&#8221; stated Running
Elk, calmly. &#8220;Him no good.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>They rode all that night in order to put as
much distance between them and the savage
bands as possible; in the morning they had
breakfast, saw to their horses and rested for
a few hours; then they were off again.</p>

<p>During that day they came upon innumerable
Indian signs; in the course of the
next they sighted a small party of Creeks
headed through the forest, and toward
evening they all but stumbled upon a large
encampment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as though they were gathering
for trouble,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;The woods are
alive with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like as not runners have been sent out
to the different villages that the Prophet is
here,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;And, of course, they
are all anxious to see him and hear his
medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much war,&#8221; said Running Elk, as they
made away from the vicinity of the savage
camp. &#8220;Creeks and Shawnee burn blockhouse
and white face tepees.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll start soon?&#8221;
asked Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The Cherokee hunter shook his
head. &#8220;Not yet. After the snow&#8217;s gone
from hills. Tribes all join together. Heap
fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds like the facts,&#8221; nodded the
young borderer to Frank. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take some
time for Tecumseh to get the tribes together
for the blow&mdash;if he can do it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next spring, then, a big outbreak may
be expected?&#8221; said Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not so soon. But it will come,
sooner or later, mark my words. The
Injuns are about ripe for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night they were unable to light a
fire because of the closeness of the Indian
bands; and the greater part of the next
day they were forced to remain in hiding
because of the parties of savages constantly
encountered. This went on for some days;
they were unable to cook their food the
greater part of the time, and had little real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
rest, for it was necessary to guard against
surprise every moment.</p>

<p>After about a week of this sort of thing,
Jack, one morning, said to Frank:</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem as though we were going
to locate your father&#8217;s land grant in a hurry,
does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We&#8217;ll never be able to
move in that direction now. It must be
alive with Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;And we were
just on the edge of it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think we&#8217;d better do?&#8221;
asked Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t go back to Tennessee,&#8221;
replied the young borderer. &#8220;That would
be as dangerous as trying to locate the land
marked on your chart. About the only
thing I can see for the present, at least, is
to make our way south to Mobile, and halt
there for a while until this excitement
among the redskins dies out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Frank. And the Cherokee
hunter grunted his approval.</p>

<p>So from that time on their attempt was
not in the direction of Tallapoosa, but
toward the fort which stood overlooking
the bay at Mobile.</p>

<p>This they searched after a tremendous
effort through the wild country; and when
they appeared at the stockade, they were
stared at in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, youngsters,&#8221; greeted a bluff old
officer, who seemed to be in command,
&#8220;where did you come from?&#8221; And when
they told him, and related some of their
experiences, he and the group of soldiers
and frontiersmen who had grouped about
opened their eyes still wider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the commandant, shaking
his head, &#8220;you&#8217;ve had great good fortune,
lads. The country you&#8217;ve just come out of
must be as thick with excited Injuns as a
hive is with bees. I wouldn&#8217;t venture in
there with less than five hundred men.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Mobile and the section thereabouts was
fairly well defended, and had little to fear
from an uprising of the Indians alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the British are getting active,&#8221; the
boys were told; &#8220;they are sending in
supplies to the redskins; and the Spaniards
are helping them.&#8221;</p>

<p>This condition of affairs held during the
fall; the boys saw the winter come and
spring show itself in its thousands of green
shoots and blooms, and still they were
forced to remain at Mobile.</p>

<p>The whole Indian country was surcharged
with the madness excited in the people by
the religious frenzies of the Prophet, who
in turn was directed by the shrewd mind of
Tecumseh. But some of the tribes through
whose country he passed, like the Cherokees,
the Choctaws and Chickasaws, turned a
deaf ear to his plotting, for they had the
wisdom to see that his plans could not
succeed. But the others gave the Shawnees
their attention, for with England&#8217;s aid they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
felt that they could finally overthrow the
other white men.</p>

<p>During the fall while the boys were safe
in Mobile, the news came that Tecumseh
and the Prophet had visited Toockabatcha,
the great village of the Creeks. There were
fully five thousand warriors of that nation
assembled in the town; the Shawnee chief
and the magician, painted and bedecked
with all the trappings of savage custom,
made their last great appeal. The British
officers had told the Prophet that a comet
was to appear&mdash;giving him the exact time;
and the wily savage now used this information
to good advantage. Rising before the
assembled Creeks in all the impressiveness
of paint and ornaments, he proclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great Spirit will give you a sign.
And when that sign comes, the Muscogee
must take the war-path. You will see the
arm of Tecumseh, the great chief, in the
sky. It will be of fire and will be held out
to destroy the paleface.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>This prediction made a great impression
upon the superstitious Creeks. A saying
of Tecumseh, which that leader had probably
not meant to be taken literally, also
caused great excitement among the savages.
A Creek chief known to the white settlers of
Alabama as &#8220;Big Warrior&#8221; had refused to
believe that the Great Spirit had sent
Tecumseh among them. With upraised
hand the Shawnee had said to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not believe me, chief of the
Muscogees; you think I speak with a
crooked tongue. But you shall believe.
When I leave your country I will go to
Detroit; when I reach there I will stamp
my foot upon the earth; and the wigwams
of this village will tremble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unquestionably what Tecumseh meant
was that the effects of the war which would
begin upon his reaching the region of the
Great Lakes would be felt as far as Toockabatcha;
nevertheless a strange thing is said
to have happened. About the time in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
which he must have reached Detroit, a
sharp shock of earthquake shook almost
the whole of the Creek country; and the
wigwams of Toockabatcha did, indeed, reel
and tremble. Instantly the Indians recalled
the Shawnee&#8217;s words and were filled
with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tecumseh has reached Detroit!&#8221; they
cried. &#8220;He has struck the earth with his
foot and it has trembled.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was in December, 1812, and the entire
Gulf region was affected by this earth
tremor. At about the same time the predicted
comet appeared in the sky; and the
credulity of the Creeks at once saw in it
the fiery arm of Tecumseh.</p>

<p>&#8220;War with the white man!&#8221; ran through
the nation of the Muscogee. &#8220;War! The
Great Spirit has commanded it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the remainder of the winter and
the next spring, clashes took place between
the military and the Indians, who were preparing
for the war. Settlers were attacked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
hunters were driven from their trapping
grounds. At Burnt Corn, a number of
whites and half-breeds were assembled for
mutual protection; the Creeks attacked, defeated
and scattered them. Farms were
abandoned, the settlers flocking to the
numerous stockades to await the expected
onslaught.</p>

<p>Having remained idle, so far as their mission
was concerned, through the fall, the
winter and the spring, Jack and Frank, together
with Running Elk, made up their
minds that they could not afford to waste
any more time. So, in the month of July,
in spite of the protests of the friends they
had made at Mobile, they took horse and
rode into the wilderness once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a risk,&#8221; admitted Jack to his comrades,
&#8220;but, then, we can&#8217;t wait forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather face the Creeks than the
clock,&#8221; stated Frank. &#8220;They were the
longest hours I ever spent toward the last.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for the young Cherokee hunter, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
seemed greatly pleased with the venture;
the danger, instead of being dreaded in his
case, was welcomed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brave must fight,&#8221; said he, elatedly.
&#8220;Not like squaw or papoose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d just as leave dodge any fighting
at the odds we&#8217;ll have to give,&#8221; said
Jack, drily. &#8220;But,&#8221; and there was a hopeful
note in his voice, &#8220;maybe we&#8217;ll not be
molested much. You see,&#8221; to Frank, &#8220;that
section of the Alabama River where the
triple oaks stand has no white settlers; and
the Indians at this time are mustering in
the neighborhoods they mean to attack.
We might go through the entire grant which
you&#8217;re looking for and not see a single redskin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that turns out the case,&#8221; remarked
Frank, though it was plain he had
no strong expectations of the affair&#8217;s proving
so. &#8220;But let us keep a good lookout, just
the same. I haven&#8217;t had but a few brushes
with the Creeks, but I know they have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
habit of turning up just at the time you&#8217;re
not expecting them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it so happened Jack Davis&#8217; judgment
of the conditions of affairs along that
section of the river was quite correct. At
most times it would have been the region in
which to find the Creeks the thickest; but,
save for a few villages occupied by old men,
and women and children, there were no
braves to be seen. Signs were everywhere of
parties having passed that way; they came
upon the blackened remains of a half hundred
camp-fires; but not a single eagle
feather was visible anywhere about; not a
bow twanged, not a war cry sounded.</p>

<p>Jack Davis was greatly interested in the
movements of the parties who had camped
on and moved across their track.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every one of them is headed for the
settlements,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There must be
thousands of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, they knew that the uprising
was expected, and felt that the military authorities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and backwoodsmen were alert; so
they concerned themselves with the object
of their expedition alone. The triple oaks
were once more sighted; unmolested this
time, they studied the chart upon the deerskin
scroll; one by one they located the
landmarks set down, blazed trees with their
hatchets and explored. The result of five
days&#8217; work was that the old grant was
shown to be a splendidly located one, having
every natural advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth thousands,&#8221; said Jack, who
had a fairly keen eye for such things. &#8220;If
the Injuns are ever brought to see things in
the right light, your father has a fortune
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this fact greatly comforting him,
Frank was willing to turn once more
toward the settlements; so after one night
more in the river bank camp, they took to
the saddle and headed for the Tennessee
line. After the first day, unmistakable
signs of Indians compelled them to change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
their course somewhat; the twilight of the
second day found them in the forest amid a
perfect maze of fresh trails.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to be all around us,&#8221; said
Jack, as they brought up at last, and sat
their horses looking about them.</p>

<p>And he was right; for as the twilight
deepened into dusk, and dusk into night,
they saw the red twinkle of Creek camp-fires
on every hand.</p>

<small>THE ONSLAUGHT AT FORT MIMS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a time the two white boys and the
young Cherokee hunter gazed in silence at
the sparkle of the Creek camp-fires; the
woods seemed studded with them; hundreds
of savages must have been camped within a
circle of a half mile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost a miracle how we got into
the midst of them like this without seeing
any of them, or their seeing us,&#8221; said Frank
Lawrence.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d been traveling very quietly,&#8221;
said Jack. &#8220;I suppose that accounts for it.
But,&#8221; and he gazed around at the gleaming
sparks of red light among the trees, &#8220;we
must get out of this, and before daylight.
If we don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll be caught as sure as the
sun rises.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;No get away in morning,&#8221; said Running
Elk. &#8220;Best go now. Too many warriors
to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the direction from which they came
the camp-fires of the Indians were fewer; so
the boys mounted once more and headed in
that direction, aiming at a point between
two of them which were farthest apart and
therefore seemed to afford the best way out.</p>

<p>There followed what they would all remember
as one of the most perilous half
hours of their lives; but, at length, they
were out of the region of the camps and
were making good speed away in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once or twice I thought sure that a
sentinel would call to us,&#8221; said Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were so close to them that they
couldn&#8217;t help thinking we were members
of their own party,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;and as they
couldn&#8217;t make us out in the dark we had a
few chances in our favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Creek heap much sleep on watch,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
charged Running Elk, with contempt.
&#8220;No good!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three rode all night; and as morning
dawned, they saw signs of the white
man&#8217;s hand all about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried Frank, &#8220;we&#8217;re closer to
the settlements than I thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless I&#8217;m wrong by a good deal,&#8221; said
Jack, &#8220;we&#8217;re not far from Fort Mims.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fort there,&#8221; said the Cherokee, pointing
toward a distant strip of woodland.
&#8220;Other side of trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not go into camp, though tired
by their night in the saddle; but cheerily
rode toward the fort, feeling that a good
breakfast awaited them. An hour&#8217;s ride
brought them in sight of the fort, which
stood on Lake Tensaw.</p>

<p>Fort Mims was built and occupied by a
half-breed named Samuel Mims, who had
lived there in the wilderness many years.
His house was a stout one of logs, and was
surrounded by a stockade, pierced by loop-holes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
for rifle fire in case of attack. The
place was only a little distance from the
lake; all about it was forest, marsh and
ravines. A large gate was let into the
stockade at the north and there was another
at the south.</p>

<p>When the Creeks began their depredations
on the border, the settlers of that
section had flocked to Fort Mims. At this
time there were some seventy-five men,
mostly white, but some also of mixed blood,
gathered behind the shelter of the stockade;
and with these were a great number of
women and children.</p>

<p>A month before, General Claiborne, who
was in command of the United States forces
in Alabama, dispatched Major Beasley and
one hundred and seventy infantry to this
place. Claiborne recognized the seriousness
of the situation and thought it best to be
prepared. When Beasley reached Fort
Mims he found an officer and about a score
of soldiers already there; and in taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
charge, proceeded to organize the settlers into
a fighting force, of which a young half-breed
named Dixon Bailey was made captain.</p>

<p>A week or so after this force was located
at the fort, General Claiborne paid a visit
to the place; seeing with a practiced military
eye the weakness of its defense, he
urged the strengthening of the stockade,
and the completing of a blockhouse which
had been started some years before, but
never finished.</p>

<p>Major Beasley was a man of unquestioned
courage; but he was a poor officer.
Being of a sanguine, optimistic nature, and
with little imagination, he belittled the
urgency of the occasion. He had a contempt
for the warlike qualities of the red
men, and did not think it worth while to
erect the defenses recommended by the
general. There were six hundred people
gathered in the enclosure; and with half
of these fighting men, he ridiculed the idea
of danger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>The boys stood in a fringe of woods.
From there they sighted the fort, and saw
one of the gates standing wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there is no guard,&#8221; said the observant
Jack Davis. &#8220;That looks like a
foolish thing to do in a time like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys were about to ride forward
when Running Elk hurriedly, and in a
low tone, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No go! Creek braves out there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drawing in their mounts, Jack and
Frank looked keenly about; sure enough,
from above the high grass at a point indicated
by the young Cherokee, they saw the
nodding eagle plumes of a half score savages.</p>

<p>&#8220;And watching the fort,&#8221; whispered
Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Creek make ring around fort,&#8221; said
Running Elk.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true!&#8221; said Jack, startled, his
roving glance taking in the indications.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got it surrounded, and are tightening
the circle all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THEY SIGHTED THE FORT</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;We must warn the people in the fort,&#8221;
said Frank. &#8220;With that gate open they
are in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To stir a step in their direction at this
time,&#8221; said Jack Davis, &#8220;would be to run
into sure death. Surely, of all the people
who are inside there at this time, some one
is on the lookout; and they will see the
redskins before it is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>Knowing that it would be foolhardy to
attempt anything just then, Jack rode his
horse into a deep ravine, followed by the
others; here they dismounted, and, concealed
by a dense growth of trees and
underbrush, they crawled up the sides of
the ravine and watched the situation with
the most acute interest.</p>

<p>Jack had said that surely out of all the
people inside the stockade at Fort Mims
some one would be on the lookout. This
was naturally to be expected&mdash;it was the
very least that a military officer could do
in the heart of a hostile country. Yet it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
was a thing that Major Beasley had not
done. But to leave the stockade gate
sprawling open and the fort unguarded was
not the least of this officer&#8217;s offenses. A
day or two before a couple of negroes, who
had been sent out to watch some cattle at
pasture, had rushed in and reported signs
of Indians. A party had been sent out,
under an officer, to scout about the country;
but they had been very perfunctory in the
performance of this grave duty, and returned
saying that no Indians were in the
neighborhood, and neither had they seen
any signs of them.</p>

<p>At this report the negroes were lashed,
in spite of their protestations, and things
went on in their usual careless spirit.</p>

<p>For several hours the boys watched from
the ravine. The advance of the circling
savages had stopped; apparently they were
waiting some sort of signal. Inside the
stockade the women and military cooks
were preparing the midday meal; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
soldiers were lounging about, the children
were romping in the shade of the walls.
Another short space of time, and then the
drum beat the mess call, telling the soldiers
that their food was ready.</p>

<p>Apparently this was the signal. The
Creeks arose from out the grass, from behind
stumps, from out of hollows. Like
magic, hundreds of them, smeared hideously
with war paint, armed with scalping
knife and tomahawk, with rifle and war
club, bounded silently across the level space
between them and the fort.</p>

<p>Major Beasley was the first of the defenders
to see them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Injuns!&#8221; he cried as he darted toward
the heavy gate. The swift-footed Creeks
were also plunging toward this point; seeing
that they were discovered, they cast
silence aside and the air was filled with the
dreaded war-whoop.</p>

<p>Major Beasley reached the gate and threw
himself against it with desperate strength.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
But the savages were too swift; they gained
the gateway and before the cumbersome
bar could fall they had thrust the gate
back, and the ill-fated commander fell
before their tomahawks.</p>

<p>Soldiers and settlers both had sprung for
their rifles at the first shout of Beasley.
But before they could form for any sort of
concentrated defense the Creeks poured
through the wide open gate like the waters
of an angry sea.</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no hope of withstanding
the Indians at that point, the defenders,
or what remained of them after this
first terrible onslaught, fell back with the
women and children behind a second line
of wall. Here the gate was closed, and
lining the wall with deadly rifles the whites
began a gallant defense.</p>

<p>The leader of the settlers now took
command; and no more gallant fellow
than this half-breed ever lived. He kept
his men to their frightful task with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
most desperate resolution. So bitter was
the defense of the settlers and soldiers that
the Indians, a great number of them dead
under the walls, slackened in their attack.
With what booty they could lay hands on
they fell back before the terrible rifles.</p>

<p>But their leader was another half-breed,
Weatherford, the dreaded &#8220;Red Warrior&#8221;
of the Creeks. Upon the back of a great
charger, garbed in all the barbaric splendor
of a savage chief, he dashed among his
scattering bands. His great voice lifted
like a trumpet, burning them with his
scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the Muscogees men, or children?&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;Have they the hearts of
warriors, or of rabbits? You have asked to
be led against the foe; he is before you.
Shall your children say their fathers turned
their backs upon the paleface? Or will
you be able to show by the scalps upon your
lodge pole that when your chief called you
braves he did not lie?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>Lashed to fury by the scorn of the Red
Warrior, the Creeks returned to the assault.
Burning arrows were discharged, and soon
the buildings behind the second defense
were destroyed. The gates were broken
in; the settlers now fought penned up in
houses which were burning over their
heads. Soon all were dead save a party
which had closed itself up in a bastion at
the north of the fort; these fought doggedly
under the courageous direction of their
captain, Dixon Bailey. But nothing could
withstand the overwhelming strength of
the Indians; they stormed the bastion,
and in spite of the protests and commands
of Weatherford, began their dreadful work
of death once more.</p>

<p>In a frenzy of strength some of the
troopers broke apart the stakes which
formed the outer wall of the bastion. About
a half score escaped by this means, among
them being the gallant Dixon Bailey. But
it was not the fate of this fine fellow to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
escape with his life; he was bleeding from
a half dozen wounds and died a few hundred
yards from the doomed fort.</p>

<p>Broken and breathless, the remainder of
the little party ran on; a band of Creeks
had noted their escape and were in swift
pursuit; the whites had about given up
hope when they heard a loud &#8220;Hello&#8221; far
ahead.</p>

<p>Amazed, they saw in a fringe of woods
two white boys and a friendly Indian, well
mounted&mdash;and holding a number of Indian
ponies by their bridles.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; shouted one of the lads, a
bronzed, bold-faced fellow. &#8220;We have
mounts for you all, borrowed from the
Creeks. Quick now!&#8221;</p>

<p>And while the fight-worn men were
straining their pounding hearts for just a
little more speed, Jack and Frank threw up
their long rifles; like whips they cracked
and two bronzed warriors tumbled forward.
Then Running Elk&#8217;s bow sang its song of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
death and a third went to join his comrades.</p>

<p>While the fugitives clambered upon the
backs of the horses, the lads finished reloading.
Again the pieces cracked and
once more the great Cherokee bow twanged.
Amid the death yells of the fallen braves
and the ruins of Fort Mims blazing behind
them, the fugitives, with Jack and Frank
and Running Elk riding behind as a rear
guard, dashed away with the news toward
the settlements.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>OLD HICKORY APPEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> news of the deed of blood at Fort
Mims swept along the border like fire; swift
riders carried it to the hamlets of Georgia
and Tennessee; and in the wake of the
tidings went up a cry of vengeance.</p>

<p>Nowhere did the dreadful story have
more effect than in West Tennessee. Governor
Blount at once called for three thousand
volunteers to move against the Creeks,
and the hardy backwoodsmen flocked from
all points to enlist.</p>

<p>Frank Lawrence, Jack Davis and the
young Cherokee hunter, Running Elk, had
ridden through the perils of the hostile Indian
country and forced their way north by
sheer pluck after leaving the fugitives of
Fort Mims at a stockade some dozen miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
away and making sure that the troops at
Fort Stoddart had been notified. And now,
when the borderers were pouring in to enlist
in the force which was to strike a blow
against the Creeks, these three young men
were in the thick of the movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of my father, a lawyer named
Andrew Jackson, is leader of the state militia,&#8221;
said Jack. &#8220;Suppose we go see him;
he&#8217;ll tell us what&#8217;s best to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But first they consulted the elder Davis,
a stout, hardy man who had, like the other
farmers, rode into the city to see what was
to be done. He shook his head when Jack
told him of their idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you lads ought to
volunteer. It&#8217;s the duty of every youngster
on the border to do so. But as for Andy
Jackson&#8217;s doing anything for you, I don&#8217;t
think he&#8217;ll be able.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Jack, surprised.
&#8220;He&#8217;s still general of the militia,
isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the farmer, &#8220;but just now
he&#8217;s ill; in bed with the doctors attending
him. A few weeks ago he engaged in a
desperate personal affray with the Bentons,
and was shot in the shoulder. And I hear
the wound is a bad one, and he&#8217;s not mending
very fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, the lads, after some consultation
with Mr. Davis, made up their minds
that it would be a good idea to go on to
Nashville anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; admitted Mr. Davis, &#8220;that
he&#8217;s taken a turn for the better since I heard
from him. News travels slowly, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day Jack and Frank, Running Elk
having departed for a visit to the lodges of
his people, took horse and rode to Nashville,
and went at once to General Jackson&#8217;s house.
They found him upon a sunny porch in the
midst of a committee which had been appointed
to offer him the command of the
volunteers. He was a long thin man with
large bones and a frame of great natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
strength. His face was long and gaunt at
the best of times, but just now it was haggard
from the effects of his wound, and
bloodless in color. He lay back in a big
chair supported by pillows, and talked to
the committee in a low voice.</p>

<p>Frank Lawrence gave one look at the
drawn, white face and gaunt frame and
whispered to his friend:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, do they really mean to offer this
man command of an army? He looks to
be dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack nodded his head and answered in
the same low voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so. But that won&#8217;t make much
difference to the general. Anything he sets
himself to do, he does; and if he makes up
his mind to lead the expedition against the
Creeks, he&#8217;ll do it, no matter what his condition
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank, as they stood apart, waiting,
looked with much interest at the sick man.
He saw a great mop of stubborn hair standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
straight up from his head; he saw the
powerful jaw and the thin nose of the warrior.
But above all he saw the eyes, fiery,
indomitable, the eyes of one to whom death
meant nothing, but to whom submission
was unthinkable.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson was at this period about
forty years of age. He was of Irish ancestry
and had been born on the border of the
southwest territory. He had been a lawyer,
judge, storekeeper, farmer and United
States Senator. At this time he was
practicing law, farming his place, the
Hermitage, and acting as general of the
Tennessee militia.</p>

<p>&#8220;What authority have you to offer me
the leadership of this body of men?&#8221; asked
Jackson from the depths of his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;The right of citizens of Tennessee, gathered
in public conference,&#8221; said the spokesman
of the committee. &#8220;We cannot wait
for formal action by the state or national
governments; it might be fatal to do so.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Even now these red fiends may be gathering
for a blow at our frontier.&#8221;</p>

<p>The deep-set eyes of the sick man
glowed; apparently this was the sort of
spirit of which he altogether approved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; said he in a voice filled with
sudden deep strength. &#8220;To prepare quickly
is the only way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will accept?&#8221; asked another
of the committee, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wound is bad,&#8221; said Jackson, &#8220;and
I shall be of less service than I should be
otherwise. But, still, I will march. And
if the general government will only keep
hands off,&#8221; grimly, &#8220;we shall in the end
have peace in Israel.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the committee, much elated by
their success, had departed, Jack and
Frank were brought to the notice of the
general.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said he, holding out one
gaunt hand to Jack, &#8220;I recall you. How
is your father?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;Quite well.&#8221; Then presenting Frank,
he added: &#8220;This is my friend from Virginia,
Frank Lawrence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general shook the boy by the hand
and had his black servant bring chairs.
When they were seated, he looked at them
smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You both look as though you&#8217;d been
through some hard service,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have,&#8221; replied Jack. &#8220;A full year
of it. And we&#8217;ve just returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>They then related to Jackson, in as few
words as possible, the story of their expedition
to locate the land grant. The general
listened to the harrowing tale of the
assault upon Fort Mims with frowning
brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the work of Tecumseh and his
brother, the wonder-worker,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;And to repay it means that the Creek
nation must feel the weight of the white
man&#8217;s power. And they shall, if it&#8217;s in my
power.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Then Jack spoke of the errand that
brought them to the Hermitage, and the
general nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll need young men like you two,
who know the country, to scout ahead of
our force. If you volunteer, that shall be
your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two thanked the officer, and left
quite buoyantly, riding to the Davis place
next day, and there accepting the call for
service against the savages. The order went
out that the volunteers were to assemble at
Fayetteville in October; but before this
time arrived the disturbing news came
that the Indians were threatening Madison,
in the Mississippi territory, which
then took in a large portion of the present
state of Alabama. From his sick room
Jackson sent forward Colonel Coffee, a
huge fighting man, who was related to
him by marriage. Coffee&#8217;s command was
but three hundred in number, and consisted
of cavalry and mounted riflemen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
but these hardy woodsmen had no fear,
and rode toward Huntsville, in the threatened
district.</p>

<p>On October 4th Jackson was not able to
stand on his feet, much less mount a horse,
and so was not able to join his command
upon the day named. However, three days
later, like a gaunt ghost, he rode into camp,
his will alone keeping him in the saddle.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he taken command when a
rider from Coffee&#8217;s column dashed into the
camp at Fayetteville with a dispatch saying
that the colonel&#8217;s small command was in
danger of attack by a huge force of Indians.
Camp was broken and the Tennesseeans
moved forward. In spite of the fact that
they had a disabled commander they
marched thirty-two miles that day; the
end of it found the force near Huntsville,
and the news then came that Coffee&#8217;s danger
was not as pressing as supposed, so Jackson
at once went into camp.</p>

<p>Next day he crossed the Tennessee River<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
near Huntsville, and joined Coffee&#8217;s little
force of horsemen. The first thing to be
done now was to find a well located place
to be used as a depot of supplies. Under
the guidance of Jack Davis, who knew the
country like a printed page, they moved up
the river to Thompson&#8217;s Creek and laid out
a work which the commander named Fort
Deposit.</p>

<p>While at Fort Deposit preparing for the
plunge into the wilderness, the boys one
night while reclining upon a blanket outside
General Jackson&#8217;s tent heard the commander
and Colonel Coffee going over the
plans for the campaign against the Creeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here,&#8221; said General Jackson, as
he lay weakly back upon a sort of couch of
boughs covered by a bearskin, &#8220;we have a
depot at the most southerly point of the
Tennessee River. All our supplies can be
sent down to us in boats without trouble.
The first thing to do is to open a military
road through the forest and over the mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
to the Coosa River, and there establish
a second depot. The great idea is to create
a permanent communication between East
Tennessee and Mobile. Once we reach the
Coosa that will be easy, as the Alabama River
can be used for the remainder of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in opening this way you&#8217;ll encounter
many hostile Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll destroy all armed bands,&#8221; spoke
the general. &#8220;And not only the bands,
but their villages as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first the boating of the army&#8217;s supplies
down the Tennessee River met with unforeseen
obstacles because of the inexperience
of the contractors who had this most important
work in charge; then the cutting
of a road through the dense forests, the
bridging of streams and the continuing the
way over the Raccoon and Lookout Mountains
to the Ten Islands of the Coosa was a
grim labor for even these hardy borderers.
However, on about the first of November
they reached the Coosa; and here another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
work was constructed, which was given the
name of Fort Strother.</p>

<p>Here there was more trouble and delay
by the contractors; but Jackson grasped the
situation in his own ready hands, impressed
all the horses and wagons in the settlements
roundabout, and so the army&#8217;s requirements
were much relieved.</p>

<p>The military force, as it had progressed
into the hostile country, had been joined at
different points by small bands of Cherokees.
These Indians had long been upon a friendly
footing with the whites, and as they were
the natural foes of the Creeks they readily
consented to join with Jackson against that
nation. By the time the fort upon the
Coosa was completed the Cherokees numbered
some hundreds of young warriors, led
by enterprising and warlike chiefs. On
the second night at Fort Strother a fresh
band of Cherokees came up, and both Jack
Davis and Frank Lawrence were delighted
to see Running Elk among them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;How?&#8221; said the young hunter, as he
threw himself from his horse and shook
hands with them, a wide smile upon his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; replied Frank. &#8220;And you look
quite fresh and lively yourself, Running
Elk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you,&#8221; spoke Jack, who had
a great regard for the young brave. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a good sized war party you&#8217;ve ridden in
with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much want fight Creeks,&#8221; stated Running
Elk. &#8220;Creek bad medicine. Make
big war. All die like wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Creek town of Tallushatchee was no
great distance from Fort Strother, and this
last band of Cherokees, so it seemed, had
passed quite close to it in the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap Creek warriors at Tallushatchee,&#8221;
said Running Elk to the two boys, after a
time. &#8220;Great dance. Council of warriors
and chiefs. White chief must be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>As this seemed to be a piece of important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
information, Jack Davis went to the general&#8217;s
tent and informed the sentry that he
had some important news to communicate.</p>

<p>&#8220;The general will see you,&#8221; said the sentry,
a few moments later as he returned.</p>

<p>Jack entered the tent. He found a number
of officers present; among them was
Colonel Coffee, the giant leader of the cavalry.
The youth saluted General Jackson
and upon being asked what he had to say,
told of Running Elk&#8217;s story of the Creek
village. When he had finished, Jackson&#8217;s
eyes went to Coffee&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as you said, colonel,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;They are making ready an attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coffee nodded, and spoke in a deep voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll attack us within a week,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>But General Jackson shook his head and
replied, grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wrong in that, at least. We&#8217;ll
not await an attack. Take one thousand
men and strike at Tallushatchee as hard as
you can.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Coffee sprang alertly to his feet, and
pulled his sword belt a hole tighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Within an hour,&#8221; answered Jackson.</p>

<p>The Creek town lay some thirteen miles
to the east, across the Coosa; and the energetic
Coffee immediately began getting his
men together, horse and foot, for the advance.</p>

<p>As the backwoodsmen and militia were
eagerly responding and falling into line, the
colonel turned to Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that country across the
river, Davis?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ve hunted
it many a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll depend upon you to lead us
by the best way,&#8221; said Colonel Coffee, &#8220;and
to give me some notion of the lay of the
country in order that I may make my plans
for this little job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the force under the giant colonel
forded the river, its commander had a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
clear idea of the natural formations; moreover,
Jack and Frank, with Running Elk
and a scouting party of young Cherokee
braves, were riding ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a piece of sharp work,&#8221; said
the young Virginian to his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;ll reach Tallushatchee
before morning; and if the
Creeks are in the frame of mind Running
Elk reports, there will be a piece of fighting
such as this border hasn&#8217;t seen for many a
day.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>THE BLOW AT TALLUSHATCHEE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> few miles from the Creek town
Colonel Coffee brought his command to a
halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Houston,&#8221; said he, to a young ensign
who sat his horse near by, &#8220;take a few scouts
and make a reconnaissance of the village.
Find out, if you can, how many redskins
there are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ensign, who was Sam Houston, years
afterward hero of San Jacinto, and president
of the Texan republic, saluted and
rode forward; he signaled to Jack, Frank
and Running Elk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; said he, in the rough,
hearty fashion for which he was noted in
the little army of Tennessee. &#8220;And you,
too, Injun. There&#8217;s a little thing or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
to be done before daylight grows too
strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>The four rode on together, while the cavalry
dismounted and, with the foot soldiers,
lay upon their arms to await their return.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the colonel&#8217;ll attack before
daylight, though, will he?&#8221; asked
Frank.</p>

<p>Young Houston laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Coffee is a first
class fighting man, and that means that
he&#8217;s going to make sure about the odds&mdash;for
or against him. If I were leading this
crowd, I&#8217;d walk into that nest of redskins
with every gun going and without asking
a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>The discipline of this hardy backwoods
army was none of the strictest, and the line
between officer and private was not very
sharply drawn, so Frank was not at all
backward in replying.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t forget, Houston, that Colonel
Coffee has his men&#8217;s welfare to look to as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
well as the Creeks to beat. Why run risks
with other men&#8217;s lives when a little care
and prudence will make it unnecessary?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again young Houston laughed; and
there was a note of recklessness in it which
seemed to rise above everything else. For
this young man, almost boy, was one of the
most fearless spirits of the border. The
time was to come, though, when he was to
look after the lives of his soldiers with even
greater care than Colonel Coffee, when he
was many years older, and responsibility
had tamed his wild nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there would be more
danger for us than for the redskins,&#8221; stated
he, humorously. &#8220;Another thing: Here&#8217;s
a good chance to make a mark in the war;
so why not do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>About a half mile from Tallushatchee
they drew up and dismounted. Making
their horses fast among some trees, they
stole toward the village with all the secrecy
of stalking animals. Through the trees they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
caught sight of the fires, neglected, but still
glowing redly. The huts and lodges lifted
before them in dense masses; a sentinel
stalked to and fro at intervals around the
town; now and then a dog howled dismally.</p>

<p>Because of the sentinels they could not
venture too near. However, they were
able to count the number of fires, and so
were able to reckon upon the number of
warriors with a fair degree of accuracy.
For a half hour they prowled about the
Indian town, endeavoring to learn all that
was possible; but then the dogs began to
get wind of them; their howls were
changed to sharp distrustful barks and the
stalking, shadowy sentinels became alert
and suspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;About time to draw off, I&#8217;d say,&#8221; remarked
Jack Davis in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Creek all awake soon,&#8221; said the Cherokee
hunter.</p>

<p>Houston agreed, reluctantly, that this
was very likely so, and that remaining in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the vicinity of the village, now that they
had secured all the information possible,
was useless. So they drew off silently as
they had approached; when they reached
the spot where their horses had been tied,
they could hear the savage barking of the
village dogs lifted to a higher pitch than
ever; and as they mounted and rode away,
the other unmistakable noises from the
town showed that the hostiles had been
aroused from their sleep and were even
then preparing to meet the hated paleface.</p>

<p>Houston, a half hour later, had reported
the facts they had gathered to Colonel
Coffee; and in a few minutes more the
entire command, horse and foot, was once
more upon the march. As quietly as possible
the leader advanced his men toward
Tallushatchee and drew a line about it.</p>

<p>Dawn showed itself palely in the eastern
sky; the savages caught sight of their foes
with the first slanting rays, and a yell of
defiance and hate went up from them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
The same rays showed Colonel Coffee the
strength of the Indian position. In spite
of the fact that his force outnumbered that
of the Creek warriors, that leader, knowing
the work ahead before the Creek nation
was subdued, and knowing that every man
would be needed, looked troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will pick a half hundred off
like flies if we rush them as they are now,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>So, craftily, he began to plan to draw
them out; by a feint he accomplished this.
Thinking they saw a chance to strike a
deadly blow, the Creeks rushed forward
with exultant yells. But the whites
closed around them like a ring of iron
and there began a most desperate combat.
Rifles cracked, pistols exploded vengefully,
tomahawks and hunting knives rose and
fell in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.</p>

<p>It was the first engagement of the sort in
which Frank Lawrence had ever been; but
he stood shoulder and shoulder with Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
and fired and struck with purpose and deliberation.
To all intents he was as steady
as a veteran. Jack had taken part in more
than one desperate affray with the red
men in his expeditions into their hunting
country, and so he was more or less familiar
with their methods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for the wounded Creeks,&#8221; he
advised Frank as he reloaded his piece.
&#8220;They are never too weak to strike another
blow. And they are not always dead when
they appear to be so. They have a habit
of lying quiet and entangling your legs
when you come within reach, and pulling
you down within reach of a knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Coffee raged among the Indians
like an infuriated giant. His great sword
rose and fell; he always had a clear space
around him which his weapon&#8217;s sweep
constantly made larger. Ensign Houston
fought like a panther. He seemed to glory
in the dangers which beset him; wherever
the battle raged thickest he plunged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
his shining face and wild laugh, and the
bravest of the Creeks shrank from his crashing
blows.</p>

<p>Tighter and tighter closed the steel-like
ring about the red men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember Fort Mims!&#8221; was the slogan
of the backwoodsmen. &#8220;Strike hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>Desperation itself was the conduct of the
Creeks; they fought like trapped wolves,
ever seeking to break through the circle of
their foes. But at length, when the last
rifle had cracked, the last pistol had spoken
its sharp sentence of death, the last hatchet,
sword and knife had ceased to rise and fall,
the smoke of the conflict slowly lifted and
drifted away. Of the warriors of Tallushatchee
more than a hundred and sixty
were slain, and the remainder were taken
prisoners. And when the white men took
their way back to the river through the
morning light they bore upon improvised
stretchers six of their own men dead, and
almost a half hundred wounded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>AN INDIAN MESSENGER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Fort Strother things were going with
little smoothness; in spite of all that
General Jackson could do, supplies came
very irregularly through the forests and
across the mountains. As things stood,
almost any other commander would have
fallen back until arrangements could be
made to feed the army; but Jackson held
on grimly. He knew that this was the
time to strike; if he retreated the savages
would at once conclude that it was a sign
of fear on the part of the paleface, and so
their ravages would have grown greater
than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;The contractors must do better!&#8221; declared
the haggard commander of the forces
of Tennessee. &#8220;No matter what comes or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
goes, this force must hold its place. I&#8217;ll
not retreat!&#8221; One gaunt hand was lifted
as he spoke; there was a stain of fever
in the hollow cheeks, his deep-set eyes
glowed lion-like from under his bushy
brows. &#8220;The men who are risking their
lives to protect this border must have food;
and if it&#8217;s not sent them, those who have
neglected their duty will reckon with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack and Frank were seated just outside
the flap of Jackson&#8217;s tent, when the commander
spoke these words to his officers
within. Jack nodded to his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care to be an army contractor
and have the general on my trail,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t stop at much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not he,&#8221; said a young Nashville lawyer,
who was in the scouts. &#8220;Jackson is a man
who accomplishes everything he sets out to
do. He does not know what fear is, and
has the most resolute will I&#8217;ve ever known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it seems to me he&#8217;ll need it all,&#8221;
said an old hunter who had been driven in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
from the forest by the Creeks, and who had
enlisted in the volunteers in an effort to
retaliate. &#8220;It&#8217;s a deal to undertake, this
feeding so many men so far away from any
place, where supplies can&#8217;t be had handily.
A small party can carry and kill all it needs
for months; but a force like this can&#8217;t go
further than its supply train can follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was this same night that Jack and
Frank were visiting in the camp of the
friendly Cherokees just outside the fort.
They sat at a camp-fire with the father of
Running Elk, a stately old chief with a
hard Cherokee name and great fame as a
warrior and hunter. Running Elk was
also there, as were numerous braves of the
tribe. Conversation with them was most
difficult, as everything had to be translated
by Running Elk; and as his knowledge of
English was very limited, the boys had to
work hard to make themselves understood.</p>

<p>It was while they were so engaged that a
sudden commotion began upon the outskirts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
of the camp; loud voices were heard in
the Cherokee tongue, then the rush of
moccasined feet in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! What&#8217;s all that?&#8221; asked Jack
Davis, looking around.</p>

<p>The Cherokees about the fire had arisen
and were talking excitedly among themselves
in the laconic Creek jargon.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; demanded Frank
Lawrence of Running Elk.</p>

<p>The young Indian hunter, who had been
listening intently to the voices beyond the
light circle of the camp-fire, replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Messenger from Talladega. Much hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few moments a group of Cherokees
came forward, bearing a burden between
them; they approached the fire and the
white boys saw that it was an Indian brave
whom they carried; as Running Elk had
said, he seemed badly wounded.</p>

<p>However, he was strong enough to talk;
impressively he began to tell his story to
the Indians, but in the midst of it, catching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
sight of the white youths, he broke off.
Holding out his hand to them, appealingly,
he said in fairly good English:</p>

<p>&#8220;Young paleface, I, Black Bear of the
Cherokee people, ask you to carry my message
to your chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak, Black Bear,&#8221; said Jack, quietly;
&#8220;and be sure we will do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wounded Indian lifted himself upon
an elbow and proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am of the village of Talladega; we of
that village are friends of the white man.
Four suns ago the Red Sticks attacked us;
they had us ringed about with spears and
arrows, and they were as many as the leaves
of the forest in summer. We fought, but
we were too few to drive them away. Then
we held a council, and our old men said we
must get a runner through the enemy to
bear the news to the white man, our
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are the chosen one, are you?&#8221;
asked Frank.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;I am the fourth,&#8221; said Black Bear,
steadily. &#8220;The others were killed before
they got out of sound of the council
lodge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get through?&#8221; asked
Jack Davis.</p>

<p>The brave grimaced; apparently he had
no liking for the methods he had been
forced to use.</p>

<p>&#8220;The courage of the warrior was no use,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;So another way had to be thought
of. I crept through their line with the
skin of a hog drawn about me. It was not
until I had cast it aside and stood upright
that one of their sentinels saw me; and his
arrow pierced my shoulder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you made your way here?&#8221;
cried Frank, wonderingly.</p>

<p>Black Bear nodded, stoically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to bring to the white
chief the news that his friends of the
Cherokee people are in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a very few minutes the two boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
were seeking admission to the presence of
the commander of the army. Upon being
admitted, they found General Jackson
seated at a roughly hewn table, writing
in the light of a half dozen candles.
He lifted his powerful face, now so drawn
by long lines of suffering, and looked at
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked, patiently
enough. &#8220;The sentry says you have news
of importance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack saluted and stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;A messenger has just reached the
Cherokee camp, general. He&#8217;s from the
friendly town of Talladega, and carries the
news that the place is besieged by the
Creeks, and is in great danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly Jackson was upon his feet; the
officers in the tent looked up alertly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is this messenger?&#8221; said Jackson.
&#8220;Let him be brought here, and with an
interpreter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can speak English very well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
general,&#8221; now spoke Frank Lawrence.
&#8220;But he&#8217;s badly hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well!&#8221; The commander reached
for his hat, and the officers prepared to
follow him. &#8220;Lead the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seated upon a fallen tree beside the
Cherokee fire, General Jackson listened to
the story of Black Bear; and when he had
heard it all, he looked at his officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;This appears to be a most grave situation,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;for the town seems in
great danger. From this man&#8217;s story the
Creeks are in force, and a blow dealt them
now would have a double purpose&mdash;it would
rescue the Indians who are our friends, and
it would go far toward breaking the power
of the hostiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>The opinions of the officers present were
that it was an opportunity not to be lost.
At once they returned to Jackson&#8217;s tent;
others of the senior officers were summoned
and a brief council of war was held. Before
dawn the bugles blew, and the drums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
rolled; horse and foot, the army of Tennessee
fell into column, and with the graying
of the eastern sky, pushed across the river
and toward Talladega.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>CAPTURED BY THE CREEKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> in all his previous advances, General
Jackson sent a body of horsemen before the
main column, under command of the giant
Colonel Coffee. In advance of these, again,
rode the scouts and pathfinders, mostly
Indians and hunters who knew the country
through which they were passing.</p>

<p>Jack and Frank were in this party of
keen-sighted trailers, and rode side by side
down the forest aisles and across the shallow
streams. Jack regarded his friend with a
humorous look.</p>

<p>&#8220;This kind of a thing is different from
Richmond,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t find
there things so stirring, nor so exciting, of
an early morning, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Well, not usually,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But,&#8221;
and he nodded his head, &#8220;I&#8217;d not have
missed it for a good deal. And now that
my father has had the news about his land
and, according to his letter, is feeling quite
comfortable about it, I&#8217;m in no hurry to go
back to Virginia, I can tell you. Things
are not so regular here; but they have a
great sight more go in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank, while they were still at Fort
Deposit, had received a letter from his
father, expressing great pleasure at the
news sent him; and also telling of the
gratification it gave him to hear of his boy&#8217;s
gallant conduct. It was Jack who had
written to tell him of this, without Frank&#8217;s
knowledge. Frank had been dubious as to
the result when he learned of it, but his
father&#8217;s letter had settled all this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger, my dear boy,&#8221; the old man
had written, &#8220;is a thing which every man
must face in one form or another. That
you have faced what has come to you in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the performance of your duty pleases me
beyond description. And since that other
duty (your aid in defending the homes of
those who have befriended you) has arisen,
I can only say, God bless you. Do what
you have to do with all your might, and
never think of yourself or me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old gentleman was always game, I
remember,&#8221; said Jack, who had been handed
this letter by Frank, and who had read it
with a great deal of interest. &#8220;And I&#8217;m
glad I wrote him as I did; for he&#8217;s as proud
of it all as a hen that has a gosling for a
chicken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank laughed once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very good thing that you did
write,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for now I can stay on
down here until all this trouble&#8217;s over and
not feel that father is worrying about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The country through which they were
passing was one of huge timbered stretches,
streams, ravines and canebrakes; the scouts
were forced to go slowly, searching out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
best way for the column of troops to follow;
also they were compelled to watch for lurking
parties of hostiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are sure to know of what took
place at Tallushatchee,&#8221; said Jack to his
friend as they rode along. &#8220;And they are
also sure to be watching us. Creeks don&#8217;t
need much cover, as I guess you know by
this time; and a little attention to the bush
and canebrakes&#8217;ll not be thrown away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea of a lurking foe was not at all
pleasant to the young Virginian; but he
held his rifle ready and set his jaw and
guided his nag along without an instant&#8217;s
hesitation. They had covered half of the
thirty miles to Talladega when the formation
of the country caused the scouts to
separate and advance in detached groups.
The two boys still remained together, Jack
in advance and Frank close behind; they
rode along a narrow ridge which rose up
like the vertebr&aelig; of some monster; upon
all sides of them was lowering tangled forest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and canebrake. In the distance they could
hear the crashing progress of their fellow
scouts, but they could not see any of them
because of the tangle.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, without an instant&#8217;s
warning, a band of Creeks rose up, apparently
from their very path; before they had
a chance to fire a shot, to strike a blow or
make an outcry, they were dragged from
their horses; and in a few moments lay
bound with thongs of deerskin, and gagged
with sticks thrust between their jaws and
tied fast.</p>

<p>Silently and expertly the Creek braves
performed their task; then with the two
prisoners thrown across the horses, they
made their way like shadows into the
depths.</p>

<p>That it was a war party was plain to the
boys by the variously colored paints which
streaked their faces, and from the war bonnets
of eagle and heron plumes upon their
heads. As Jack had guessed, the leaders of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the horde surrounding Talladega had sent
out groups of spies to watch for the advance
of the whites, and the lads had had
the bad fortune to stumble upon one of these.</p>

<p>Cleverly, readily, with the sureness of
men accustomed to the ground over which
they traveled, the Creeks hurried through
the forest, aiming to get out of the path of
the advancing whites; once they felt they
had done this, they veered slightly and
headed in the direction of their operations
at Talladega. Night fell, but the party of
spies pressed on; at length they came in
sight of the camp-fires of their main body;
they halted, and one of them blew a clear
bird-like call. Almost immediately it was
answered by a hidden sentinel; then they
advanced about twenty-five yards further.
A half dozen Creeks rose up from the concealment
of stumps and glided from behind
trees. Greeting the newcomers, they examined
the captives by the light of torches
kindled at a masked fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;Ugh! much good horse,&#8221; spoke a fat
brave, as he passed a covetous hand over
the animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;White face heap jump!&#8221; exulted a
gaunt savage, hideously disfigured by war
paint and pox-marks. His snaky eyes were
riveted upon the bound boys and gleamed
with wicked anticipation. &#8220;Much jump
when Muscogee torture.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lads were pulled from the horses&#8217;
backs; much to their relief, the gags were
removed from their mouths and their legs
were unbound. However, their hands were
kept tied behind their backs; and in this
way they were marched forward into the
camp of the besiegers.</p>

<p>In the heart of this, surrounded by rank
on rank of sleeping and squatting Indians,
they were bound back to back to a tree.
Three braves were stationed with them as
guards; what stir they had caused subsided;
apparently their cases had been put
aside until morning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, turning his head as
far as possible to get a glimpse of his friend,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got into a kind of mess, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like it,&#8221; agreed Frank.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve lost horses, rifles, saddles and everything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s bad enough,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;But,&#8221;
and there was a grave note in his voice,
&#8220;we stand a fair chance of losing our lives
as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment or two;
then Frank said, soberly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bad scrape. I wonder what sort
of odds we have against us in the matter
of escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Jack, in a low warning
tone.</p>

<p>The three Creek warriors detailed as their
guards were moving up and down, silently;
they were armed with spears and hatchets
and knives, and appeared to be a surly, suspicious
trio indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, I say, Red Stick,&#8221; said Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
to one of them. &#8220;I&#8217;d like a drink of
water.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guard spoken to looked at him uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; spoke he, and went on in his
slow pacing to and fro.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the young borderer,
&#8220;you, then,&#8221; to a second, &#8220;could you get
me some water?&#8221;</p>

<p>This savage shook his head and said
something to the third guard in the Muscogee
tongue. But that brave also seemed
puzzled, and growled impatiently like a
bear that had been disturbed. Two or three
times more Jack tried them; then being
satisfied by their manner he said, in a relieved
way to Frank:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you can go on with what you
were saying. None of these fellows speaks
English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are in the middle of them all,&#8221;
said the young Virginian, his eyes going
about the camp with its hundreds of prostrate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
and huddled forms, &#8220;and as we have
no notion about what to-morrow is going to
bring us, it would be best, I think, to begin
counting our chances of getting away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only good chance is in General
Jackson&#8217;s coming up with the army,&#8221; said
Jack. &#8220;But,&#8221; and like Frank, he allowed
his gaze to go about the sleeping camp,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of men&#8217;s escaping from Indian
villages with as many chances against them
as we have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; spoke Frank, hopefully.
&#8220;We may be as lucky as they.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell what might turn up,&#8221;
said Jack, his voice colored by the hope
he caught in that of his comrade. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
look into the prospects a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. The guards
paced up and down with lagging steps, the
sleepers were as motionless as logs; from
the depths of the woods came the calls of
night birds and the occasional howl of a
timber wolf. The fires had grown a dull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
red; through the thick of the trees a crescent
moon was sending pale trails of light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just across from me,&#8221; said Frank, who
faced the north, &#8220;is the sleeping place of
one whom I take to be a chief. Maybe he&#8217;s
the commander of the whole band. At any
rate, all our things have been put in his
charge, rifles, horses and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Jack, thoughtfully.
&#8220;That&#8217;s interesting.&#8221; He seemed to consider
the proposition for a moment, then
added: &#8220;But, tied up as we are here, I
don&#8217;t see what good it will do us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we were not tied up,&#8221; said
Frank.</p>

<p>Jack caught at something in the tone
which caused a thrill to shoot through him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked, in a
hushed way.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hands are untied,&#8221; said Frank.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been working at the thongs for the
last half hour. Keep still now; I&#8217;m going
to see what can be done for yours.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>Jack felt a fumbling about his wrists;
the tree to which they were tied was not a
very large one, and Frank had no difficulty
in reaching around it, even though his back
was turned. Frank&#8217;s long, strong, clever
fingers had been noted in the school at
Richmond, and Jack now recalled some of
the feats which his friend had then performed.
So it was with growing interest
and hope that he felt the fumbling at the
thongs increase.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you doing?&#8221; he asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;The knot&#8217;s the same,&#8221; answered Frank,
&#8220;but I broke my nails badly on my own;
so this will be harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, in a few minutes, Jack, to his
keen delight, felt the thong loosen. He
had difficulty in restraining the cry of exultation
which leaped to his lips, but
managed to pass the supreme moment
without giving any evidence of the situation.
A little more and the thong was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
loose enough for him to slip his hands
through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;feel around for the
knots in the strip that fasten you to the
trunk; once we get them untied we&#8217;ll have
some sort of a chance, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tree to which they were bound was
well within the shadows; they worked
quietly, and so did not attract the attention
of their guards. The knots were hard to
find and when their searching fingers had
found them, they were in such difficult
positions for working that it was almost
impossible to do anything with them.
However, they gave themselves steadily and
doggedly to the task and, finally, were
elated to feel the tough leather give; a few
moments afterward their bonds were in such
a condition that they could step out whenever
it pleased them to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that that&#8217;s done,&#8221; breathed Jack,
&#8220;let&#8217;s give a little more attention to the
lay of the land.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>The quiet of the night, the uneventful
nature of their duty, had caused the
braves guarding them to lag in their steps.
Finally one of them, his war club upon his
shoulder, had paused and leaned against a
tree. It was not long before the other two
had followed suit. However, as all three
of them faced the captives there was no
apparent increase in the chances of the
latter for escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are keeping their eyes on us,&#8221;
said Jack, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see they are,&#8221; spoke Frank. &#8220;Do
you suppose they suspect anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About our being loose? No. If they
did, we&#8217;d hear from them without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stillness hung heavily over the camp.
Some distance away, the ring of braves
about the town of Talladega occasionally
gave evidences of being upon the alert; but
the warriors here, perhaps worn out by a
day of conflict, slept like tired animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we only had our rifles and our horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
under us,&#8221; said Frank, longingly, &#8220;we
could make a rush for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quiet,&#8221; said Jack, for he feared their
talking might be noticed by the guards.
&#8220;I think I hear something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack faced the denser section of the wood
in which the Creek camp was pitched.
For some little time he had been watching
the thin, trailing moonbeams as they
filtered through the limbs and clambering
vines. The pallid rays gave no light of
any consequence; indeed, they only seemed
to make the shadows deeper. The rustle
of the small wild things of the wood occasionally
came from the tangle, but as Jack
had looked and watched, there had come a
sound which was different, a regular purposeful
sound which to his quick ears and
attentive mind suggested the advance of
some one or something who desired to
remain unseen and unheard.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Frank, after a space.
He had listened but had heard nothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;I get a sound now and then,&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;It comes from off here in the woods, and
sounds like some one stealing up to have a
look at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably one of the Creeks,&#8221;
whispered Frank.</p>

<p>But Jack, listening, only pressed the
speaker&#8217;s arm for quiet. For the sound
had gone on in the tangle, coming nearer
and nearer. It was so faint, even at its
loudest, that not once did it attract the
attention of the three braves on guard. At
times even Jack fancied that he must be
mistaken, that it was nothing more than
his excited imagination. But then the
sound ceased; to his amazement he saw
first one form and then another lift itself
from the ground. That they were Indians
was evident even in the dense shadow; but
why they should approach in that silent
fashion puzzled Jack extremely.</p>

<p>The three Creeks, all with their faces
toward the captives, had their backs to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
place where the mysterious night prowlers
had appeared, and so they did not see them
appear; neither did they see them advance.</p>

<p>Within a half dozen paces of the boys
one of the newcomers raised his hand in a
warning gesture for silence. There was
a characteristic something in the gesture
which Jack Davis immediately recognized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Running Elk!&#8221; was his mental exclamation.</p>

<p>Step by step the Cherokee hunter and his
companion advanced. Within springing
distance there was a pause; then with the
silent bound of the panther, each leaped
upon a Creek guard. Without a sound the
unsuspecting braves fell under their blows;
like lightning they were upon the other one
before he fairly realized what had taken
place, and with strong bronze fingers twisting
about his throat he was borne to the
earth.</p>

<p>The lads needed no words to tell them
what to do. With a shake they were free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
of their bonds; a half dozen steps took them
to where their horses were tied, the saddles
still upon their backs. Near by, and perilously
close to the sleeping form of the chief
of whom Frank had spoken, were their
rifles, powder horns and other equipment;
noiselessly possessing themselves of these,
they cut the ropes which held their horses
and quietly led them toward the spot where
Jack had seen Running Elk and his fellow
hunter appear.</p>

<p>The third Creek had been quickly disposed
of; and now the two Cherokees were
free to turn their attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horses, good!&#8221; muttered Running Elk
in Jack&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Make &#8217;um fast run&mdash;away.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the edge of the thicket the boys
climbed into the saddle; the two hunters
mounted behind them. Then with a word
to the faithful nags, they rode unnoticed
through the Creek camp. A signal whistle
was heard from a sentinel at the outskirts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
This was the sign that speed, not silence,
was the necessary thing; so they dug their
heels into their horses&#8217; ribs and with a scattering
flight of arrows dropping harmlessly
about them, they dashed away into the
forest.</p>

<small>A FIGHT&mdash;AND A REVOLT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no pursuit by the Creeks, and
after the first mile or so the doubly laden
horses were permitted to slow down; and
then the two Indians slid to the ground
and ran easily at their sides, one hand upon
the saddle.</p>

<p>A half hour brought them in sight of the
spot where Jackson&#8217;s men had camped for
the night; passing the sentries, they were
received by their friends with surprise and
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never expected to see either of you
again,&#8221; said one of the scouts. &#8220;Not many
get away from the Creeks when they once
fall into their hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later the two boys rolled themselves
in their blankets and went to sleep;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
they felt that as Jackson was so close to the
Indians, the morning would see a battle.
And in this they were right.</p>

<p>At sunrise the haggard general was
abroad, issuing his commands. The troops
were quickly under arms and advancing
through the forest.</p>

<p>The force of savages besieging Talladega
numbered more than a thousand. They
were well armed, having many rifles and
muskets supplied by the English, besides
their spears, war clubs and bows and arrows.
They were worked up to the proper war
pitch and did not hesitate to give battle.
With yells they greeted the force of frontiersmen,
and plunged forward to the fight.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson had studied the tactics
of the Creek nation in warfare, and so had
a pretty clear idea of what they would do.
With a few orders, he arranged his soldiers
in the form of a crescent, the horns pointed
forward. His horsemen were placed upon
the flanks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;As the Creeks rush forward, as I think
they will do,&#8221; said the general to Colonel
Coffee, who led the cavalry, &#8220;drive forward
without delay, and get behind them. Then,
as we force them back, let them feel your
strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>All being ready and the savages, their
war cries sounding, filling the air with
arrows, Jackson said to Jack Davis:</p>

<p>&#8220;Advance on foot with a score of men and
engage them with rifle fire; as they advance,
fall back until you get the order to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Promptly Jack passed the word to his
fellow scouts. They dismounted and went
forward, flitting from tree to tree as they
went, firing sharply and making a great
pretense of eagerness to push forward.
Instantly the arrows of the Creeks rained
about them; an occasional bullet clipped
the twigs over their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are great fellows to waste their
ammunition,&#8221; said Jack, from behind a
huge cottonwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_163.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE ARROWS OF THE CREEKS RAINED ABOUT THEM</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Frank Lawrence drew a bead upon a
particularly active foeman and fired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And seeing that it&#8217;s so
hard to get in their case, you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d
be more careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the war-whoops grew shriller and
the fire thicker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fall back slowly,&#8221; ordered Jack.</p>

<p>The scouts did as directed. Eagerly,
triumphantly, the redskins followed; faster
and faster the little band under Jack retreated;
like a bronze tide the Creeks
pursued. This was exactly as Jackson had
figured. Coffee&#8217;s cavalry was soon in their
rear, awaiting the word.</p>

<p>When the party of scouts reached the
main body, Jackson signaled for volley
firing. Feeling the real weight of the force
confronting them for the first time, the
Indians retreated. To their consternation
they found themselves surrounded; like
their brothers at Tallushatchee they were in
the center of an iron ring. Bitterly they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
fought, like rats in a trap, all the time beating
at the ring in an effort to break through.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the rawness and
confusion on the part of some militia, there
is scarcely any doubt that General Jackson
would have ended the Creek war right
there. But unused to the grimness of a
protracted fight the militia at one place
gave way; and before they could be rallied,
the savages had discovered the break made
by their retreat, and poured through it in a
frenzied stream.</p>

<p>In this way seven hundred hostiles
escaped to face Old Hickory on another
day in the wilderness. But even as it was,
three hundred of them fell before the rifles
of the Tennesseeans; and this, added to the
blow dealt the Creeks at Tallushatchee,
went a great way toward weakening their
power.</p>

<p>Jackson saw the advantage he had gained,
and was eager to follow it up; if he had
been able to do so he would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
enabled to force the Creeks into another
battle before many days and so delivered
the blow which failed at Talladega.</p>

<p>But it was not to be so. Many things
conspired to prolong the brave Tennesseean&#8217;s
task. In the first place, much to his amazement,
no supplies were being sent them
from Fort Strother; indeed, a rider brought
the news that the fort itself was almost
destitute. To maintain an army in the
wilderness without food is of course impossible;
and so, instead of pressing forward to
the victory which would have ended the
war, the army was forced to retreat.</p>

<p>On top of this came the tidings that the
brigade of troops left at Fort Strother to
protect those wounded at Tallushatchee
had been ordered away by the commander
of another division which was also operating
in the hostile country.</p>

<p>Jackson was never a man of mild temper;
and seeing the result of all his work
snatched from him in this way caused him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
to burst into a furious denunciation of all
concerned. Raging like a baffled lion he
fell back on Fort Strother. Even his
friends advised him to continue his retreat
to Fort Deposit on the Tennessee.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot maintain your army here,&#8221;
he was told. &#8220;Go on falling back until
you have accumulated enough supplies;
then you can push on once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the stubborn spirit of Jackson was
aroused. Weakened as he was by his
wound, haggard, worn and really in a
dangerous state due to his over-exertion,
still he was resolved to retreat no further.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hold my position at the Ten
Islands,&#8221; declared he, &#8220;if we have to live
on acorns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because of this inefficiency of those who
were in charge of the army&#8217;s supplies, and
because of the loose nature of the terms
under which his men had volunteered,
General Jackson was soon plunged into a
series of crises which would have broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
the spirit of a less powerful man. Besides
the Tennessee militia, there was a body of
men in his force known as the United
States volunteers; these troops, because of
the lack of food, demanded to be led back
to the border. There is no doubt that the
army was in a wretched condition, needing
not only food, but clothes and shoes as
well. However, General Jackson realized
that if they were allowed to have their
way, the chances were against the advance
ever being resumed. So without hesitation
he refused to sanction the demand.</p>

<p>Officers and men joined together in a
renewal of the petition, giving their reasons
in detail. In great anger the commander
again refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were sent out to subdue the hostile
Creeks,&#8221; said he, sternly, &#8220;and until that
is done we shall not turn our backs upon
the wilderness!&#8221;</p>

<p>Finding him unyielding, the militia now
became mutinous; they broke ranks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
doggedly prepared to take the trail back to
the border. But like lightning Jackson
acted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward, volunteers!&#8221; he cried, drawing
his sword. &#8220;We shall see who is commander
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The volunteers threw themselves across
the path of the dissatisfied militia with
ready rifles. Seeing that blood would be
shed, and not desiring any such extreme
action, the militia officers advised their
men to give up their purpose. Sullenly
the militia obeyed, and so the first of the
mutinies at Fort Strother was at an end.</p>

<p>A little later discontent broke out once
more; this time it was the volunteers, and
it was the militia, now loyal to the commander,
who were called upon to put the
outbreak down.</p>

<p>Some time after the settling of this second
uprising of the hungry soldiers, Jackson
received word that a large store of
supplies had arrived at the depot on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Tennessee. Feeling sure that they would
at once be forwarded, the general said to
his officers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Food is at hand; if it is not here in
two days, I will consent to fall back.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in counting upon the promptness of
the contractors, Jackson made a mistake.
The supplies did not reach Fort Strother
upon the day set; and bitterly disappointed
he was forced to give the word to take the
border trail. But even then he had not
entirely given up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remain behind if only two men will
stay with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly a half dozen, Jack Davis and
Frank Lawrence among them, stepped
forward. Jackson&#8217;s deep-set eyes glowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Volunteers!&#8221; he cried, sweeping the
ranks with his stern gaze. &#8220;Volunteers to
hold Fort Strother against the Creeks!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes one hundred and nine
men had responded; and the army to the
tap of a single drum set off for the border.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
It now looked as though the thing were at
an end; but not so. Barely a dozen miles
from the fort the returning soldiers met a
large herd of cattle being driven forward.
This was the meat expected by the general;
delighted, the soldiers halted, killed what
they required and settled themselves for a
feast.</p>

<p>But when they had finished and had
formed to resume their homeward march
they were astonished to receive the command
to face about and return to the fort.
At once they rebelled. But General Jackson
was on the ground, and at once took
the situation in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men!&#8221; he cried, one hand uplifted,
&#8220;you have the food you required. In the
future things will be better. Turn back.
The work the border requires of you is yet
to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cry of dogged protest went up from the
men; one company, in spite of its officers,
started forward. With blazing eyes, Jackson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
rode forward, some of his followers at
his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you ten seconds to turn back,&#8221;
he shouted, as he rushed his horse at them.
Sullenly, doggedly, muttering their anger,
the company fell back upon the main body.</p>

<p>No move was made homeward by any of
the others; but at the same time neither
did they show any disposition to face about
as ordered and march back to the fort.
General Jackson threw himself from horse,
the pain of his wounded arm forgotten;
and he stalked among the rebellious troops
with bent brows and blazing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soldiers!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You are all men
of the border. You know its dangers. In
the face of the rising savage tide you swore
to serve your state; like brave men you
moved forward to strike a blow at the
murderers of your fellow settlers. But you
have had a change of heart! Why is this?
Has the wilderness frightened you? Have
the savages, whom you have twice beaten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
broken your spirit? You have said it was
lack of food which turned your thoughts
homeward. Well, here is food in plenty.
Be men; march back to Fort Strother in
good spirits; and in one month we shall
have ended the campaign.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the men refused; even while he was
speaking, the boldest of them broke their
ranks; the others followed suit; in a mass,
disorganized, with no thought of anything
but their own desires, they moved forward
on the road home.</p>

<p>In a fury Jackson seized a rifle from one
of them; his left arm was powerless, and
he was unable to level the rifle in the usual
way. So he stepped back to where his
horse was standing; resting the barrel of
the weapon across the animal&#8217;s neck, he
covered the mutineers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let any man among you make a step
forward,&#8221; he shouted, fiercely, &#8220;and I will
shoot him as I would a snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a statue of wrath and command he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
stood for a moment&mdash;alone. Then Colonel
Coffee and another officer, each armed with
a rifle, leaped to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; cried Jack Davis to his
friend.</p>

<p>Frank answered promptly; and as they
moved forward, the remainder of the scouts
followed. Then some companies of volunteers,
possibly ashamed of their conduct,
lined themselves up behind the heroic
leader. The mass of disorganized soldiers
hesitated and wavered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fall in!&#8221; thundered General Jackson.
Automatically, the ranks were reformed.
&#8220;About-face!&#8221; They turned toward the
wilderness fort once more. &#8220;March!&#8221;</p>

<p>And away they went, their rifles on their
shoulders, sullenly but steadily. The iron
will of Jackson had conquered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spirit of revolt which had risen up
in Jackson&#8217;s army would not down.
Though unflinchingly faced by him it rose
and rose again; for these men of the border
lands were wild, uncontrolled fellows
who knew no discipline and were accustomed
to receive orders from no man.</p>

<p>Once Jackson brought two pieces of artillery
to bear upon them, loaded and the gunners
with lighted matches in their hands.
But as often as he suppressed the mutinies
just as often they broke out in a fresh
place. So persistent did the thing become
that the authorities of the state of Tennessee,
and those at Washington, evidently
having little hope of securing any real
service from such a discontented force, took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
a hand in the proceedings; the result was
that the men were gradually recalled. At
one period the indomitable Jackson had
but a hundred men left him.</p>

<p>But then the tide turned. Because of
his own persistent efforts, those of the authorities
whom he aroused, and the good
will of those of his officers who had returned
to the settlements, a new army was
raised. By the middle of the following
March some five thousand well conditioned
troops were assembled at Fort Strother.</p>

<p>During this entire time of stress and falling
away, Jack Davis and Frank Lawrence
clung to the cause of the general. And now
that his star was once more upon the rise,
they were delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any other man, almost, would have
gone down under that fight and never
risen again,&#8221; said Jack, admiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll not be long now before he gets to
work again,&#8221; said Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be as easy a task as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
would have been some time ago,&#8221; observed
the young borderer. &#8220;The Creeks have
pulled themselves together, and they are
once more ready to make a fight of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>During all this time of trouble at Fort
Strother, things had not been at a standstill
in the Creek country; that savage tribe
had been ravaging and burning; the war-whoop
had been heard in many a little
hamlet, and the tomahawks and scalping
knife had made their presence felt. But
the white man had not done much in return.
Floyd and a body of Georgia militia
had marched against the Indian towns on
the lower Tallapoosa. At a place called
Autosee, in November, he attacked the redskins
and drove them from the field, slaying
some two hundred of their warriors.
However, though much was expected of
him, Floyd did little more. An expedition
up the Alabama River under General Claiborne
was a failure.</p>

<p>From then on it was seen that if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Creeks were subdued it would be Jackson&#8217;s
force that would do it.</p>

<p>But while the renewing of his army was
in progress, Jackson had not altogether
closed his work against the hostiles. He
was not the man to pause, even though he
had but soldiers enough to man his few
pieces of artillery. But by the early part
of January, 1814, he had a strong body of
men at Fort Strother; though more were on
their way, he felt that he need not wait for
them.</p>

<p>About eighty miles south of his position
on the Coosa River was a fortified camp of
Creeks, a place called Tohopeka. At this
place the savages were assembling in great
numbers; the scouts from Fort Strother had
been watching them for some time and
keeping the general closely in touch with
what was happening there.</p>

<p>One night Jack Davis and Frank Lawrence
arrived at the fort, their horses in a
lather of foam. At once they went to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
commander&#8217;s tent and were admitted. The
general was seated at his table going over a
map he had made of the region, and he
looked up as the boys entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what is there to report?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been scouting in the neighborhood
of Tohopeka for the last week,&#8221; said
Jack. &#8220;And things have reached such a
state we thought it best to come in at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221; The deep-set eyes of the general
began to glow. &#8220;So the Indians are still
gathering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; replied Frank. &#8220;All the
villages for a hundred miles around the
fortifications are pouring braves into it.
There is something of great moment about
to be attempted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are better armed than I ever saw
Indians before,&#8221; put in Jack. &#8220;And they
are drilling and practicing the maneuvers
of the white man&#8217;s sort of warfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Jackson, with a quietness of demeanor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
which was ominous, asked a number
of pertinent questions; and when he
had learned all they had to tell, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do. And as you go out, give
my compliments to Colonel Coffee and beg
him to step into my room.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were outside, Frank said in
a low, exultant tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;That means a move of some sort, as
sure as you live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Coffee was closeted with the
commander for perhaps an hour; then
other officers of rank were summoned.
The result was that on the following day
Jackson led a force of nine hundred
mounted riflemen, some two hundred
Cherokees and a cannon for use against
the Creek fortifications.</p>

<p>Five days this little army marched
through the wilderness; then camp was
made upon the banks of Emuckfan Creek
at a place only three miles from the Indian
fort against which they were moving.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Preparations were made for a sharp blow to
be delivered next day; guards were placed
about the camp in the charge of alert young
woodsmen, among whom were Jack and
Frank.</p>

<p>Quiet reigned in the forest; the water of
the stream went rippling over the stones in
its bed, the wind stirred in the tops of the
trees, the stars looked down peacefully.
But even in the midst of the quiet, Jack
was not at rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just why it is,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ve got the feeling that something is
going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same with me,&#8221; replied Frank,
in the same whispering tone which his
friend had used. There was a short pause,
then he added: &#8220;I suppose I&#8217;m foolish
for thinking so, but somehow I&#8217;ve got the
notion that the Creeks are on the move to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you feel that?&#8221; asked
Jack, and there was a note in his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
which Frank knew as mingled eagerness
and alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancied I heard and saw something
several times off there to the south and
west,&#8221; said the young Virginian.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it,&#8221; breathed Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been thinking the same thing. And the
fact that we both saw and heard it shows
that it is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly, but with caution, the word was
passed to the guard; at once it began to
pass from man to man on watch about the
camp. Then the lads stole back to the line
of tents, and in a few minutes the men
were aroused and stood under arms awaiting
the word from their officers.</p>

<p>And it was well that they were prepared,
for suddenly the forest seemed alive with
savages; the night was filled with the war-whoop
of the border-land. But to the
amazement of the exultant savages, instead
of a sleeping camp, they found lines of
riflemen. A sleet of lead swept among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
them, and with yells of rage they fell back
into the cover of the woods. Once more,
after dawn, the Creeks attacked the white
men, but again they were beaten off, and
retired to their fort.</p>

<p>Jackson now managed to get sight of
this, and also had an opportunity of estimating
the number of savages facing him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are too strong!&#8221; said he, promptly.
&#8220;With the force at hand we&#8217;ll be taking
too many chances in attacking them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not fall back,&#8221; objected the
officers.</p>

<p>Jackson nodded and smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t be afraid, sir,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;The Creeks will still be here when we
come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having made up his mind, Jackson at
once set his little army upon its retrograde
motion. Eagerly the savages followed,
hanging to his flanks persistently. At a
stream called the Enotachopco, the Creeks
attacked the rear guard fiercely; but with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
the aid of the six-pounder gun they were
held back until the stream was crossed.</p>

<p>On the twelfth day after its departure the
army reached Fort Strother once more.
The result of the expedition was that the
great prospective movement of the Indians
was halted and that two hundred of them
had fallen in the fighting. Jackson&#8217;s loss
was twenty-four killed and seventy-one
wounded.</p>

<small>THE BATTLE OF THE HORSESHOE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> only did the fights at Emuckfan
and Enotachopco Creeks dash the spirit of
the Indians, but they also gave Jackson&#8217;s
raw troops a taste of war as it is waged in
the wilderness. Instead of harrying the
border and setting it ablaze as they had no
doubt intended, the savages were content to
hold their fort at the bend of the Tallapoosa
and await the aggression of the white man.</p>

<p>Being reinforced by more militia and the
thirty-ninth regiment of regulars, General
Jackson grew quite at ease and confident
that success was at last at hand. With
three thousand troops he moved down the
river, where some thirty miles south he
established a new base of supplies called
Fort Williams.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me manage to collect enough provisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
to last my army but four weeks,&#8221;
said the commander at this place, &#8220;and I
will end the war at a blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just about this time there came the
tidings from Fort Stoddart that fifteen
hundred men with a great store of supplies
were about to move up the Alabama River
to a place called Hickory Grounds. This
was, perhaps, the most cheerful and helpful
news that Jackson had heard in a long
time; and from then on he felt safe as to
the future. Let him but open the way to
that point and his work in the Creek
country was done.</p>

<p>So, getting his force under arms, he led
them through the forest to the bend of the
Tallapoosa where the Creeks had made
their stronghold. This bend was much
like a horseshoe in shape, and built across
the narrow tongue of land was a &#8220;snake
fence&#8221; barrier of logs and earth. Between
the wall and the river was a space of
perhaps a hundred acres; and in front of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the wall trees had been felled to form a
shelter for sharp-shooters. The lodges and
huts of the Indians were built upon the
river&#8217;s edge; and here their canoes were
tied, to be used in escaping across the river
if the fort was carried by the white men.</p>

<p>The leaders of the savages had boasted
of the strength of this position, of its possibilities
for defense or retreat. In the first
of these claims there was some truth; the
barrier was strong and the zigzag manner
of its building enabled the Indians to sweep
an attacking party with a deadly cross fire;
but as to retreat in case of need, it lacked
every necessary advantage.</p>

<p>Coming in sight of the bend, Jackson
put his plan of battle into instant operation.
He planted his infantry before the barrier
of logs and mounted his two small cannon
on a hill eighty yards away where they
commanded the Creek position. Colonel
Coffee, with the mounted troops and
friendly Indians, was instructed to ford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
the Tallapoosa and hold the opposite bank
at the rear of the fort.</p>

<p>Allowing time for the cavalry to accomplish
this movement, General Jackson
opened with his two pieces of artillery; the
shot thudded upon the logs and buried
themselves in the earth, but apparently no
damage was done.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks as if the guns were too small,&#8221;
observed Jack Davis, his keen eyes upon
the Creek barrier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark to the redskins hoot!&#8221; said Frank,
as yells of mockery came from the stronghold.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll not be for long,&#8221; said Jack,
grimly. &#8220;I see the general&#8217;s brows coming
together. He&#8217;ll be fighting mad in a little
while, and then the Indians had better
look out.&#8221;</p>

<p>But General Jackson knew the position
selected by the Creeks was a formidable one,
and so held back any desire he might have
had to launch a frontal attack. This, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
felt sure, would mean the certain death of
many of his soldiers; and if the thing could
be done without that, he was most anxious
so to accomplish it.</p>

<p>While the two small guns were booming,
and the riflemen were endeavoring to pick
off any Indians who showed themselves, the
Cherokees who accompanied Colonel Coffee
in his movement toward the rear of the
Indian fort introduced a piece of Indian
warfare which at once brought matters to a
crisis. Running Elk, who was among them,
saw the Creek canoes tied upon the opposite
bank. Without a word he plunged into
the water and began to swim toward them.</p>

<p>At once his fellow braves understood his
purpose; they also entered the water and
struck out for the further shore. The Cherokees
seized the canoes; also they set fire to
the Creek huts and lodges. A great blaze
went up; the smoke ascended in clouds.</p>

<p>Seeing the flames, the infantry before the
barrier of logs could no longer be held in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
check. They begged of the general to permit
them to storm the Indian works, and
Jackson, seeing their eagerness and not
desiring to dampen their spirits at this critical
time, finally gave the word.</p>

<p>With a rush, the white men, both regulars
and militia, went at the log wall.
Paying no attention to the sleet of arrows
and bullets, they scaled it like monkeys.
The first over was young Sam Houston; he
had an arrow through him almost at his
first move; but this did not stop him.
With his clubbed rifle sweeping a path
among the savages he shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys. Strike hard, and the
thing is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack and Frank were at his heels; the
infantry then came smashing down upon
the Creeks; and amid the blaze and smoke
of the burning huts the desperate contest
was on. Rifle and pistol cracked, bows
twanged, sword and tomahawk rose and
fell. At length the savages felt that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
were being worsted, but when they turned
to run they saw that their way was blocked.
Again they faced their foe and battled like
cornered wolves; they did not ask for
quarter and were given none. With the
memory of the slaughter at Fort Mims in
their minds the whites struck vengefully.</p>

<p>By mid-afternoon the battle was over;
the Americans had forty-five men killed
and about one hundred and fifty wounded.
The Creeks had lost eight hundred in killed,
and three hundred were prisoners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This was the last of the Creeks as a warlike
nation; almost the entire remainder of
the tribe fled into Florida, where they were
protected by the Spanish flag. When General
Jackson a little later marched upon
those villages which he knew were located
upon the lower Tallapoosa, he found them
deserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said Jack Davis, as he and
Frank sat, their rifles laid aside in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
peace of the Davis farmhouse, &#8220;the war is
over as far as the Creeks are concerned; and
I don&#8217;t think there will be much delay
about the rights to your father&#8217;s land.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this proved to be the case; for General
Jackson, in his great treaty with the
Indians at Fort Jackson some time later,
secured great tracts of territory from the
subdued savages in payment for the harm
which they had done. In this ceded land
was the old grant held by Mr. Lawrence,
and as soon as his possessions could be removed
from Virginia to the border-land, he
took possession of it.</p>

<p>Slowly the settlers took up the land all
about; but the hunting grounds remained
as they had been for many years. And
through the aisles of the mighty forests,
across the streams which wound like silver
threads among the trees, Jack Davis, with
Frank Lawrence and the Cherokee brave,
Running Elk, often wandered with rifle and
bow, stalking deer and hunting bear and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
panther. Peace was upon all the border-land&mdash;a
peace which they knew would not
have come for many years if it had not been
for the invincible resolution of Andrew
Jackson.</p>

<small>LIFE OF ANDREW JACKSON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1765 an Irish workman of
Scotch blood, and of the name of Jackson,
made up his mind that the grind of poverty
in his native land was too great for endurance.
So, with infinite labor, he scraped
together a little store of gold; and with his
wife and two children he took ship for the
colonies of America of which he had heard
such glowing tales.</p>

<p>George III had been five years king of
England, and the French war which gave
Canada to the British had just ended when
the little family of Jacksons landed at
Charleston in South Carolina. Having no
money with which to purchase land, they
set out with some others for the interior.
Here, one hundred and fifty miles from
civilization, and in the midst of a wilderness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of dark pines, a little clearing was
made near Waxhaw Creek, a log cabin
erected, and a home established in the
new land.</p>

<p>But the clearing bore only one small crop.
Then the head of the house sickened and
died; the widow was left with fear in her
heart as to the future of herself and her two
children. However, after the burial, she
drove across the border into North Carolina,
where her sister had established a home;
and there in a log house, only a few days
after her arrival, was born Andrew Jackson,
seventh president of the republic, and one
of its greatest soldiers.</p>

<p>This was on March 15, 1767. About a
month afterward Mrs. Jackson with her
children set out for the home of her brother-in-law,
named Crawford, who lived some
distance away. Her sister, Crawford&#8217;s wife,
was an invalid; and for ten years Mrs.
Jackson lived with them as a sort of housekeeper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>In this frontier home Andrew Jackson
grew up into a rather ungainly, rough, hot-tempered
boy. Among his comrades he
was something of a bully. It has been long
said of such boys that they are usually
cowards; but in Andrew&#8217;s case this was not
true, for there was no more resolute spirit
on the border than his, even at that early
day. Andrew&#8217;s mother had some thought
of making a minister of him; at any rate
he was sent to the little log schoolhouse,
and was taught to read; his handwriting
was wretched and during the whole course
of his life he never learned to spell.</p>

<p>During the boyhood of Jackson great
questions were on the verge of settlement;
the colonies revolted and England set
about crushing them under the weight of
her trained regiments. During the boy&#8217;s
ninth year the Declaration of Independence
was signed; and in a little while Marion,
known on the border as &#8220;the Swamp
Fox,&#8221; Sumpter, known as &#8220;the Game<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
Cock,&#8221; and other heroes of the wilderness
were up in arms and stemming the tide of
the red-coated aggression. Amidst the Tory
outrages, the assaults of the ferocious dragoons
of Tarleton, Hugh Jackson, Andrew&#8217;s
elder brother, took up his rifle and joined
the defenders. He met his death in the
fight at Stono.</p>

<p>The old log church was used as an hospital,
and Mrs. Jackson was among the women
who nursed the wounded Americans. Not
long afterward the terrible Tarleton and his
men made a rush at Waxhaw; at another
time the army under Cornwallis attacked
the same place, and the settlers fled from
his fury. Six months later the Jacksons
returned to the ravaged section. Andrew
was now fourteen, tall and thin and seething
with the desire to take part in the fighting
going on all around him. His first
chance was when, as one of the guard of a
place attacked by the Tories, he helped to
beat them off. Dragoons arrived in time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
to save the Tories, and among the captured
were Andrew and his brother.</p>

<p>It was while he was with the British
that Jackson was slashed by a sword in the
hands of an officer whose boots he had refused
to blacken. Afterward, wan and
wasted by neglect and disease, the two boys
were exchanged. From this experience the
brother died; but the stronger constitution
of Andrew carried him through and he recovered.
Mrs. Jackson then heard that her
nephews were suffering in the British prison
pens at Charleston; she hurried to their
aid, but was attacked by the fever and died.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson was now alone in the
world, and without a penny. After the war
he turned his little stock of learning to
good account. He became a backwoods
schoolmaster. Then he studied law, worked
in a country store, and afterward opened a
law office at Nashville in Tennessee. During
all of this period Jackson was acquiring
a reputation as the wildest and most daring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
spirit on the frontier; the hot temper of
his boyhood had cooled not a jot; he was
always ready for any deed of hardihood,
and the rough spirits of the border learned
to fear his anger.</p>

<p>His marriage, from unusual circumstances
attending its contraction, was one
which promised many sorrows; but as a
matter of fact proved a very happy one.
Jackson was sent to Congress from Tennessee,
and was afterward made senator.
Later he resigned and returned to Nashville.
Here at different times he practiced
law, kept a store, and farmed. It was at
this period that he was made commander
of the state militia, and subdued the Creeks.
Afterward he became head of the army of
the United States in the southwest, and
drove back the British at New Orleans.</p>

<p>After defeating the Seminole Indians in
Florida, and performing other services of
great value to the country, Jackson began a
political career full of tumult; he was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
most loved and most hated man of his time.
He was elected President of the United
States in the year 1828, and again four
years later. Then he retired to the quiet of
the &#8220;Hermitage,&#8221; near Nashville, as his
home was called, and spent the remainder
of his life in peace. He died June 8, 1845.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_author.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. McINTYRE was born
in Philadelphia. At six
years of age he was sent to
St. Michael&#8217;s Parochial School in
that city, and says he considered
his education finished when he left
it four years later to begin the
earning of a living. He was employed
as a boy at a great many
things, and admits he was very bad
at all of them. One of his later
jobs was clerk in a secondhand
bookstore, where he acquired an overwhelming love for
history and also became acquainted with all the
masters of English literature. His chief ambition as
a boy was to read more than anyone he knew, and
he says, &#8220;I think I won this race by a million laps.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to write when he was about twenty and
he found the way to be rougher than he imagined.
Finally he began to get stories into the newspapers,
then into the magazines, and at last, in 1902, published
his first novel, &#8220;The Ragged Edge.&#8221; His first book for
boys, &#8220;Fighting King George,&#8221; was published in 1905,
and since then thousands of boys have learned to look
for a new &#8220;McIntyre book&#8221; every year. His most
popular series, &#8220;The Young Continentals,&#8221; was begun
in 1909. Mr. McIntyre has also written a great many
plays, a number of which have been produced professionally,
and some novels, including the well-known
&#8220;Ashton-Kirk&#8221; series. His books for boys are:</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
